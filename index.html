Watching Ken’s video left me alarmed about the methods fossil fuel interests used to mitigate awareness of climate change. I find their use of sending propaganda to K-12 teachers to be particularly insidious, as these are the people educating the children of the country. I find it  morbidly curious, evidently a lot of thought and effort was put into spreading their message as effectively as possible. Targeting the populace through misinformation campaigns propagated at the governmental level was likely no easy task … imagine if they put the same effort towards combating the crisis. One new takeaway from the video for me was learning that 97% of scientists agree on anthropogenic climate change, I had assumed the number would be closer to the low 90’s. I found it surprising that only 30-45 % of middle/high school teachers selected the range of 81-100% in the poll by the NCSC on the amount of scientists that agree on climate change. Another thing I learned from this video was of the existence of conservative think tanks such as the Heartland institute. Reading about them online shows that they worked with tobacco companies in the 90’s to “discredit the risks of second-hand smoke.” I found their actions towards public health, and policy to be particularly despicable. 
<br><br>
 Reading the book was a different experience than I had imagined going into it. The book is well structured and well written, I find it hard to take issue with the way they presented their argument (not the argument itself mind you). All of their factoids in the introduction are easy to read, as well as clearly cited. The book additionally brings up certain issues within the climate change debate that I find questionable-- namely the use of non-scientists purporting credibility. The section in the book talking about the author of Merchants of Doubt was convincing enough to make me question how much truth is there in her claims. As an aspiring scientist, the next section disputing the validity of the science findings of “hyper-productive alarmist climate scientists” addressed doubts that I had about the consensus. One part in which I felt the authors of the book were cherry picking data was when they discussed the availability of proper climate change data. The authors said that “ more respondents said “very inadequate” (1 or 2) than “very adequate” (6 or 7), with most responses ranging between 3 and 5 (pg 22).” This claim raised a red flag to me as it comes off as intentionally misleading. Rather than outright deny claims that the climate is changing, nor that humans contribute to the change, the book tries to sow skepticism. As a rhetorical tool, I found that to be much more effective. If the book had instead tried to convince me that everything I had been hearing was wrong, and took a more radical stance, it likely would not have convinced me at all. That is something I think could be applicable to rhetoric for trying to convince others of climate change. If people use alarmist rhetoric like Wells, they might instead end up alienating skeptics/deniers. I hope that this week Ken will rebut the points in this book.

I, too, agree that it is despicable that these fossil fuel companies find it morally okay to spread misinformation about the climate crisis. Especially immoral to use the public school system to attack and "brainwash" the young and uneducated population. The sad fact is that in today's day in age, we are encouraged to present it as a two-sided issue, or else climate deniers will become angry. Its a shame it must be presented this way because it causes mistrust about climate education.  
<br><Br>
97% of scientists that believe in climate change fact. I think the number should be around 99%. I would like to know how many scientists were selected for the survey and what the focus of the study they put their life towards and see how the numbers change. I would like to hear a review from a scientist that specializes in climate change or scientists that study-related fields such as geologists and chemists. 
<br><br>
I also found the book well written and quite scary as to how easy it would be to discredit climate change believers with the facts shared. They seem to dismiss many of the issues brought about by climate activists.

<br><hr>
I strongly agree with the points you made in your comments. First of all, it is kind of tricky and “smart” of those fossil fuel companies to target K-12 teachers and therefore the students. Just as Ken realized that educating our generation to deal with the climate crisis properly, so did these companies (but for different purposes). Lots of funds are used by these companies to misguide the new generations to achieve their selfish desire and personal interests. We have to admit that they, these companies, have such huge power to counteract the efforts we made. Resources are scarce and time is limited. When it comes to the destiny of all mankind, we are not only fighting against time, but also some people who only care about money and themselves. Just like you said, “imagine if they put the same effort towards combating the crisis“， huge difference could be made.
 <br><br>

To be honest, I underestimated the ability of Heartland Institute to persuade people to distrust anthropogenic global warming before I read Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming. Even though I have already had some basic understanding and my standpoint about the climate crisis, this article succeeded in making me feel lost again. Most reading we read before did not give too many detailed scientific substantiation, because in this way they can attract more casual readers. However, the lack of scientific evidence can also be a problem. For example, Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming might be more persuasive due to the clear scientific proof and citation.
 <br><br>

All in all, as students, due to the lack of professional knowledge and research, our thoughts are easily affected, so we should treat the surrounding information with critical thinking and not make conclusions before thinking twice.


<br><hr>
Eashwar, the point you made about the alarmist rhetoric really resonated with me. Alarmist rhetoric as Wells utilizes it only does more harm than good to the people who are on the edge. Indeed, I also get irritated when I come upon hyperbolized news headlines and other "catchy" titles that serve the purpose of creating some sort of spark of action. This, I feel, is a direct consequence of the readily accessible media we have circulating throughout our lives today. With such a means to reach people so readily, it should be expected that many will use it to try to convince others to support their argument - basically a principle of advertisement. 
 <br><br>

I was also surprised that such a high number of scientists agreed with the severity of climate changed based on the poll. I would have guessed that scientists, with their desire to produce objective data, would reach conclusions about climate change which may be deflected to a slightly more neutral point of view. However, I am actually really glad that they are stressing the severity of this problem. The general populace uses scientists as a basis of credibility when forming opinions, so it is nice to have support from the science community. However, education is a vehicle for science, and without an educational infrastructure which stresses climate change as anthropogenic, we cannot make progress as a society.

I agree with you 100%. I find it disgusting to see how think tanks like the Heartland Institute fund campaigns that aim to educate the public that climate change isn’t real. This propaganda is evil. These think tanks spend millions of dollars so that they can in turn hurt the planet and then inflict danger onto the people they have mislead.
  <br><br>
Apart of their campaign is to educate children that climate change is a “two sided” issue when it really isn’t. As a child if I was taught this propaganda I too would be convinced that climate change isn’t real. This is scary because once people are taught something it is hard to convince them otherwise. Even when I was reading this book, the Heartland Institute presented their argument very well. They seemed to do a good job at discrediting them. This seems so wrong it must be illegal! All of these lies, I get so angry reading them. Somehow this must qualify as libel. I want to sue! I know people say that the way to win this fight is through education but when the other side is doing it too and are spreading propaganda how are we supposed to win? How do we make these FOOLS stop?!

<br><hr>
I was also appalled by the fact that the fossil fuel industries and other groups that claim that anthropogenic climate change is not a real thing are targetting the education of such young children. At such a young age, especially elementary school level, kids are so susceptible to any outside information. Teaching them that climate change is not a major threat is not only brainwashing and immoral, but damaging to the world in the future. If the future generations start to be the same as the generations that came before, all is lost. Learning that these conservative think tanks were part of the movement to normalize cigarette smoking and disprove any claims about their risk doesn't really surprise me. They are doing the same things today, but it is the threat of climate change they are deescalating instead of second-hand smoke.

  <br><br>

I agree that the way the book was written was very clever. The subtle nudges towards skepticism instead of an outright, loud argument are very effective. In my high school English class, I had to write a persuasive paper as if I was a lawyer, and my teacher had us watch a bunch of mock trial speeches to prepare us. The main objective of those speeches was not to prove anything. All they had to do was push their audience beyond a reasonable doubt. Once that happened, the jury would have to debate within themselves, even if they had a strong opinion when the case opened. Creating doubt and causing people to question their beliefs are the strongest tactics that the book could have used, and they did it well.
<br><hr>
While I was reading the book and watching the video the same things you mentioned really stood out to me. This first being how shocked I was to find out that huge fossil fuel companies were targeting k-12 teachers. To me I kept coming back to the fact that the large fossil fuel companies and conservative think tanks had to sit down and brainstorm how they could be the most effective at convincing people that climate change was not due to human action. As you said they put in so much time, effort and strategy into propagating misinformation when instead it seems as if they could have put all of that time and effort into making a change or switching to renewable energy. Similarly, if they would have spent that money in educating people about what was actually taking place with climate change their would be a larger population of people that would support the fossil fuels increasing their prices, in order to switch to a more environmentally sustainable option of energy. Something else that kept nagging at the back of my mind was how thorough the whole plan was; from where they send free copies of the book, to how credible the book seemed when read, to making a free pdf available for anyone interested online all of these made me feel as if they were covering up the fact that they knew they were in the wrong. That they had to coverup their faults and get people to believe that climate change is a hoax even though they know deep down that it is true. 
   <br><br>

I agree with you. The book was super easy to read. It really targeted any audience willing to pick it up. There was heavy citation usage which may have played a role in establishing credibility for each fact that there might be controversy on. The book went into everything that people have said are true and facts around the climate crisis and denied them. The book wasn’t written to stand out and say, “Everything you have heard is wrong!” It was more written in a stance that you have heard this, however, here is some evidence that the information you heard was false and the scientists that stated that are not very credible. Unfortunately, I can very easily see how people who don’t want to admit that climate change is real read a book like this and latch on to it. Denying everything about climate change and using the book as a rebuttal or way to comfort them when people say otherwise. 
   <br><br>

The other thing that Ken pointed out in his video that really shocked me was state that were passing legislature about teaching climate change in the classroom. Montana very recently passed the legislature that when teaching climate change in the classroom that the teacher must say that the rise in CO2 is not human caused and not having a verifiable impact on the environment. In my opinion this is just wrong. It is putting a false sense of security int children’s heads that they then have to grow up and face the consequences once again of the errors that they predecessors made.
<br><hr>
When I began reading the book, I was very confused with how I should be feeling. It seemed extremely credible, with facts backed up by countless sources. Knowing nothing about the Heartland Institute prior to the reading and movie, it seemed like a notable and acclaimed organization. As I read more, I knew the book was written by climate change skeptics. Having been in English 23 for a couple weeks now, I was able to not be swayed by this opinion. However, it is terrifying to think about the people reading this book that are not as educated about climate change as my classmates and I are. When Ken stated that this was sent to teachers nationwide to teach climate change doubt to young children, I was appalled. I now wonder how the Heartland Institute became a trusted organization that the educators of the country are willing to preach its ideals. So yes, I agree that this propaganda imposed on students is indeed insidious. This only makes me think what other propaganda notable organizations are teaching to our country.

<br><hr>

I believe I'm like everyone else here, that the fact that these major methods these fossil fuel organizations like the Koch Brothers, are aiming their climate denial propaganda at the youth and education system of the United States to brainwash them into this vast growing problem of climate deniers is down right awful. Children are malleable and their brains are like sponges and they don't know any better as they learn as they go which just makes this action of brainwashing such an insidious act, as you do so state. Yet, what makes it ever so staggering is the fact that these major fossil industries fund stupendous amounts of money into institutional conservative think tanks, such as the case with our book under the Heartland Institute, to produce vast amounts of climate denial text just for them to past them out for free and specifically in the PDF format we read from and the 300,000 mailed to teachers all across the United States, as a major propaganda campaign. Not only is it aimed right at the youth and education system of the United States, but even our own political leaders of the nation, as Ken stated, at least 50,000 copies of the first version of "Why Scientist Disagree About Global Warming" were given away or sold to them. It just baffles me at how much effort that these fossil fuel industries put into brainwashing the populous into their major agendas of climate denial for more profits, as that same effort can be put into the study of climate change and the ways we can counter it's coming consequences. Think Tanks like the Heartland Institute, are thorns in the Achilles heels of climate activist here in the United States due in part with the fact that they're jobs are to be persuasive and confronting, finding small holes in what they're paid to argue against and exploit them to the best of their abilities as well as skewing the statistical data to their own benefit. "Climategate" was an incident in this where it put climatologist and other climate scientist in a bad light and gave deniers a major jump even though the emails themselves never changed the consensus on climate change. But, anyway I digress to the point that its wrongful that these companies are having such a pull in influence on the youth, education system and leaders of the nation, our nation, which makes pushes for a climate change solution as presented through COP 21, ever so difficult because the fossil fuel industries has the United States by the leash. 
   <br><br>

After reading through most of the book, I can easily see why people can begin to fall into this propaganda as much of the based data, they give many sources through their arguments and scientist interviews, however this is there job and their way of persuasion. Under the section "Global Warming Petition Project", they directly criticize the project with has a backing of  31,478 American scientists, but criticize that some may have been non-scientist field individuals (climate activist), which in their eyes is provoking the legitimacy of the petition, even though they admit to being a "strong point". Though many of the arguments as well seem strong, quite a bit of them seem statistically skewed or weak as I agree with you under page 22, with the scale asking scientist if the climate change science is adequate to inadequate, as it seems weak. Yet, for the most part, the book skips radicalism and focuses on a easy to understand argument which allows the average individuals to get a understanding of their views, and even jump to conclusions because of the science based references they make after every argument. This is the issue I see with Wallace-Wells work, as you do too, where his work crosses radicalism (climate alarmist) which has it's pros and cons, but can have it's profound backlash or scaring people into action. That's where this book is maniacally effective as it doesn't put a profound radical push of it's agenda that will leave you in fear, and instead takes a more down town approach which can easily influence the view of an average individual, ever so making these work by think tanks a thorn in the foot of climate activist in the United States.
<br><hr>

I also hope that Ken will talk more in depth about the points that were made in the book. The book claims to lay out all the reasons why the argument regarding climate change is without merit. I agree that it is evil to target children and teach them that climate change may be a hoax or not caused by humans. Teaching climate change denial to almost 10 million children? Wow. The book as you mentioned does have a nice and simple layout that is easy to follow but one that i found to be extremely redundant. Even though many of the scientists do not present the opposing view according to the book, does it really matter? If there is substantial evidence from real life events, such as natural disasters, is that not enough evidence for people to realize that this is happening now>


The book honestly did not change my opinion in any way at all. I thought that maybe it would make me question some of the sources I have read, but I still hold my opinion strongly that climate change is an urgent issue. I believe that for any theory or major discovery that threatens some big businesses, there will be skeptics and opposers. For that reason, I was not surprised at all that such books were written and even the Amazon comments on the book reflect that. The reviews have dozens of people that are arguing against the book, but why direct the energy in an Amazon review? I believe it is more important to confront those officials that are funding teachers to teach our future generation lies about the health of this planet.

<br><hr>
I completely agree that it is awful to target the children of our generation to try to convince them that climate change isn’t real. School should be a place of learning, where kids can trust that what they are getting taught is accurate and correct. While I understand that it is always important to see the other side to become more informed, I completely disagree with the tactics used by conservative think tanks and fossil fuel affiliates. Purposely sending out free copies of books filled with misinformation is wrong and doesn’t help society. It only damages future generations as Ken stated that 30% of K-12 teachers teach that climate change is a two sided issue. Even worse, over half of teachers don’t teach it at all, or only devote a small amount of time to it. This is done on behalf of institutions like the Heartland Institute, which only look out for themselves. 
    <br><br>

The book itself was extremely well written and convincing. As someone who heavily believes in climate change, this book made me question my beliefs. As the book targeted the climate change consensus, it argued that there has been an ignorance of research outside of specialization, and an increase in bias and corruption. This book made the claim that the climate change crisis is so politicized, which Is something I agree and struggle with. This book has sown doubt and skepticism in the mind of readers, taking advantage of people who are uninformed. This has only made me look forward to Ken rebutting the arguments found in this book. This book continues to make me want to make a difference, as I sat frustrated reading it. With citations, explanations, and pointed attacks on those who believe in climate change, this book is an interesting look to the other side.


<br><hr>
I agree and find it shocking that the fossil fuel companies are able to spread incorrect information to the youth of our society. The you are the ones that can make the most change in the coming years, however with this type of information being given to them, they are being set up for failure. I also agree with Ken that climate change and global warming isn't talked about enough in our public schools while it is a real world problem we are facing.

    <br><br>

As for the book I found that facts do not lie. Facts such as the percentage of scientist that believe in global warming, etc, are things that should be considered by nonbelievers but instead are brushed aside. It is becoming more clear to me that the nonbelievers have little to no factual evidence to back up their stance. What then, is there point of holding that side? Money? Politics? Nothing should come before the safety of our planet.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the way Heartland Institute misleading people on education and knowledge has a huge impact and power to sway the publics’ opinion regards to climate change. Since they target the K-12 teachers, the younger generations are easily affected by teachers as most believe what the teacher says is generally correct. I’m also furious at the government’s funding into educating wrong information about climate change. Because of this misleading information, more and more people could easily change your stands. 
    <br><br>


To seek benefits, these institutes, governments, and companies use the wrong way to misguide us. However, we should use these funds to protect our environment instead of worsening the situation. Also, the book does not provide enough scientific evidence to support its argument, especially in a more accessible approach to casual viewers. I’m sad about how they make tons of effort on misguiding people rather than leading people to take action. Hopefully, one day, our society can understand how materialism destroys our planet.
<br><hr>
I agree with all the points that you made in your comment.  The thing that struck me out the most in Ken's video was the fact that these conservative "think tanks" are going through all the effort to send out copies of a book, to teachers nonetheless, that was made to spread misinformation. It seems to me like they are trying to brainwash the youth, who are in reality the only ways who will be able to fight back.  If they are putting in so much effort to raise suspicions about climate change, it raises the question, what are they trying to hide?  The fact that the spreading of this "misinformation" is funded by the fossil fuel companies, who are the only ones that are benefitting from the use of fossil fuels and who contribute to most of the carbon emissions, should be enough to raise alarm that the information they are spreading is false, or is made to deliberately misinform.     
    <br><br>


It was also surprising for me to learn that only 30-45% of high school teachers thought that the number of scientists who agreed on anthropogenic climate change was so low.  It's also a little frightening to learn of this because these teachers are the ones who are educating the next generation, who are the ones that are going to have to fix all of the problems made before they were born.
    <br><br>


I also agree that the book made a compelling argument, and I think it would be easy to believe if you were already misinformed on the topic of climate change, and misinformed about what is all happening in the world. (another reason I am so grateful for this class, it has opened my eyes to events I had never known about).  I think if you were already doubtful of the climate crisis, it would be easy to pull "truths" out of the book and believe the things that you wanted to hear.  However, reading the book from the perspective of someone who is pretty informed about the climate crisis and believes in anthropogenic climate change, it was easy to see where they had "cherrypicked" information, as Lyers said.
<br><hr>
I was just as appalled by everything in the three chapters. I will admit that it was very hard to read knowing all of the real facts and just believing in the climate crisis itself. The cherry picking of info felt like most of the data the book provided. They picked what they wanted and twisted it as much as possible until it sort of made sense. How can they argue that scientists don't have a degree in every subject that deals with climate models or data when The Heartland Institute aren't even scientists themselves? The fact that they feel like they can have any say in factual evidence blows my mind. Reading afterwards that it comes from a conservative group funded by oil companies angered me, that automatically discredits them in my opinion and I almost feel as if they should put this info on the front cover. These people are the ones who have a political agenda, not the scientists and groups they are accusing. I am also curious as to why they chose to send this book to elementary schools, probably because they knew no one would actually buy it so they had to give 300,000 away to make their numbers better. I agree that it was surprising 30-45% of teachers guessed the number right, this is a huge problem in our education system because it is no longer a "what if," but what are we going to do.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your points. It is despicable that K-12 teachers are targeted in order to try and sway the minds of their students. The Heartland Institute, which I also knew nothing of, seems like a villainous group and I have no idea how they manage to do what they have been doing for so long. I find it hard to even try and play Devil's Advocate and justify their actions since, like you said, their actions towards public health are terrible. 

    <br><br>

It is scary how the world we live in has become so split on these notions, which seem like COMMON SENSE. I can understand how a corporation would try and discredit things that go against their brand in order to maximize profit. We are greedy people and we like money. There's nothing especially wrong with that. However, the fact that other people who are outside of the organization actually allow themselves to be swayed and end up promoting these corporations despite hard evidence that the company is hurting people, that is absurd to me. Climate change should be the people vs. the corporations. It is heartbreaking to see people brainwashed into following these corporations and turning it into a liberals vs. conservatives fight when it is going to affect us all the same way.
    <br><br>


I had the same experience while reading too. The book reads very well and honestly, to an uninformed person, it seems very valid. They aren't stretching many points, and they seem to cite all of their claims. They also use a lot of scientific jargon and that would convince people on its own that they have credibility. I truly hope that there is enough work out there discrediting this book that is easily accessed, so that people do not fall into its trap.

<br><hr>
After watching Ken’s video and reading your comment I found that I had a better understanding as to why there are so many people that don’t agree or have knowledge of the climate change. I agree that targeting teachers who are susceptible to read it, agree with it, and then teach it is rather deceitful. I have a hard time trying to understand why people would want to target young children so that they can learn from an early age to not agree and stand for the climate crisis. The book that was distributed was rather convincing and without a doubt compelling to those who don’t have true knowledge on the subject. If these deceptive books continue to be distributed to people without awareness it will create the seed within children to later on not believe that the climate crisis is a real danger and not to take charge. I also lacked the awareness of the climate crisis probably because, like Ken mentioned, most teachers do not mention the climate crisis, but after just two weeks of a lecture on true facts I am willing to do what I have to do for this issue to resolve. 
     <br><br>
After reading the book I too had a hard time finding ways that what they were saying were lies or incorrect. It was put together as though they had spent lots of time in researching the issue and had credible sources. It wasn’t until Friday’s lecture when Ken opened my eyes to the sources which most were their own. There were also many other points in the book when they would mention a fact without stating clearly who said it or where it came from. I too, look forward to hearing more of the reasons as to why this book isn’t credible.

<br><hr>
Insidious is a great way to describe fossil fuel companies and CTT. We don’t see it happening, but it’s there, it’s spreading quickly, and it’s dangerous. They are smarter than I thought they’d be. Aiming for the children via teachers? Dirty trick, but it works. What an efficient way to brainwash future generations. Aiming for opinion leaders? Good choice. Reading the book, I can see how someone who is neutral can be lured to the denier side, thinking it’s logical. It seems legit: it has sources, and they seem so confident and use seemingly logical arguments. If you just follow along, you’ll fall right in. It takes effort to question and pick apart their arguments. I feel bad for people trying to do research and stumbling across this book. They put in the effort, but it’s lies. This shows how it’s hard to get the truth. 
     <br><br>
For instance, the book referred to a study by Legates et al. (2015) in a paper published in Science & Education, which contradicts Environmental Research Letters, illustrating a contradiction among published claims. Friends of Science, a group or retired earth and atmospheric scientists, sounds like a reliable group. They disagree with Oreskes. They use so many numbers and go around the analysis that it is very tiring to follow the research and see if it’s true. For instance, the Verhaggan survey on contributors to the IPCC report showed that only 49% agree with the IPCC’s statements. But they “hid their data in a table”. I followed the link, it was in another language, I translated the page. And I had to download a pdf of the report. I gave up trying to find if the book was lying or not. It was too much work. Also, there was only a 29% response rate, so that study is inaccurate and I don’t know why they would use it besides for fluff and to seem credible. A lot of the book is fluff, such as the one by Schulte, a physician whose method they end up criticising but whose argument they still use. 
     <br><br>


However, once you read it critically, and pick it apart, it becomes enraging: they refer to Cook as a “wacky blogger” but they use bloggers as support themselves. They even argue that the surveys and counting methods for “consensus” such as the one by Naomi Oreskes are inaccurate as it excludes “prominent skeptics”. The phrasing makes it seem like skeptics are scientists or something, but they could be “wacky bloggers” themselves. 

     <br><br>

This video makes me think of how we think propaganda and indoctrinating children and censorship is a major issue in other countries, like North Korea, but it’s here. We silence the truth and force instructors to teach lies. Scientists are targeted, for example, the Climategate incident where American Tradition Institute used Freedom Information Act to try to slander scientists. The term “sea level rise” was banned in North Carolina. You really just have to question your beliefs: are they really yours or are they beliefs you accept as true just because it’s commonly accepted in the system you’re thrown into at birth? 
      <br><br>

Learning about climate change denial propaganda has made me think more about my own beliefs and other propaganda, such as the “Got Milk” phase that somehow died out. It had celebrities endorsing it, and claimed that cow milk is real milk and that it is good for you, bashing on alternatives such as coconut, rice, soy, and almond milk. Or the popular belief that we need meat for protein.


<br><hr>
The debate over climate crisis is not actually an equal battle. The climate crisis deniers would win the combat merely by evoking skepticism among the public; however, we are in the unfavorable side because we have to convince the majority to believe in our argument about the anthropogenic global warming. It is really clever but despicable for these deniers to think of such approach to trigger doubts, especially among non-scholars. It is also immoral for them to target at our uneducated generation as they are still vulnerable under such confusions. Moreover, the book seems to make sense, especially to people lack the expertise, as it is logically well constructed and used many skills to disguise the unreliability of some of the evidence. I am not sure if it is possible to defend for our side under such attack since they only need to cause confusions. It would be too hard to find out all those misleading information they give in the book and present them to the our young generation.
<br><hr>
I’m so glad you brought up the effort the fossil fuel industry is putting into this campaign to misinform the public. I would find it less evil if they simply did not know that climate change is happening and believed the argument they were putting forth. It’s sickening to realize that they are fully aware of climate change and are fully aware that they are purposely deceiving the public, namely children, for their own monetary gain. They know that the actions of their industry are causing widespread destruction, yet they care more about their own benefits than about the consequences for future generations. It is honestly disgusting. 
      <br><br>

I also thought your comment about rhetoric was interesting. Going into this reading I expected it to be much more poorly written and much less organized. The fact that it does have good structure and ample citations makes it much more believable for their intended audience. It further adds to the idea that they know exactly who they are targeting, what they want them to believe, and how to accomplish this goal.

<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion. The book has been using vague statistics to show people that even if scientists believe in climate change, the reality is not as alarming as they say. As you quoted, "very inadequate" (1 or 2) than "very adequate" (6 or 7), with most responses ranging between 3 and 5 (pg 22) "uses interviewers' answers between 3 and 5 to prove the unreliability of the data, which cannot stand scrutiny. The author used vague data to prove his argument, which is ridiculous.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you said about the formatting, writing, and citing of this book. It was clear and concise, and it used powerful, effective language that a reader could easily absorb and believe. I think what is so scary about this is all of these aspects of simply a facade. This reminds me of how a powerful, well-dressed person speaking passionately to a crowd could say nothing meaningful and still gain respect, as this book is doing the same thing. As brought up in Friday’s lecture, the so-called detailed and long citations are heavily biased and misleading. The writing is clear and convincing, but the facts fall through with deceiving data. 
      <br><br>
I also was deeply upset by the misinformation being pumped to America’s children. So much of this issue is going to fall on this upcoming generation, so to have a climate-denying curriculum being fed to our country’s future is terrifying. Greta Thunberg has shown us how much impact one young person can have on this world and it is discouraging that our country could be keeping these kids from the information that could change their lives. I really resonated with what you said about the effort being put into these denying programs could have so much impact if redirected to help fight the climate crisis. We are fighting the wrong battle here and it is a battle that is not worth fighting. I find it hard to understand why people wouldn’t want to fight for their children’s well-being. It is also so scary that books like this exist in multitude as the average American probably wouldn’t take the time to fact check and research all the sources cited. I think Americans are seeing this information and they are believing it because it’s easy. Because if they think the climate crisis isn’t real, they don’t have to change their day to day lives in any way. We have to accept the truth because even though it may be harder, we will be on the right side of history and fight to save the earth that we call home.

<br><hr>
You bring a lot of good points. I wish that there was agreement that we could all come to regarding climate change. Misinformation and the spread of it should be and has been punished severely (notably Dr. Wakefield, when he lost his license to practice after suggesting that vaccinations cause Autism). It's heart breaking when companies create harmless looking facades like the heartland institute to spread their agenda at the expense of the children's lives that they are preying on.  It's sick and hugely immoral. The teachers are the middle men in this transaction and should take some responsibility for this disbursement of misinformation. As a teacher, it is their job to know what they are teaching their children and how they can be better resources in any case of questions.
      <br><br>
When starting the reading, I wanted to read it with the same skepticism that someone who wrote the book would take to the climate crisis. I found that incredibly difficult at face value too. But I think that the message of climate crisis has been so engrained in my own mind, that I found it hard to weigh the two sources evenly. I also look forward to more discussion of the other side and how it can be reasoned with.
<br><hr>
Your comment was very insightful, and I agree with many of the points you make. Personally, there were multiple times when I read this book and almost started to believe in what it was saying, and I had to constantly remind myself to snap out of it. The authors do a great job establishing their credibility and forming an argument that is convincing, but if you read the book with a skeptic attitude, you'll definitely be able to point out flaws in their argument. One of the most obvious things, as mentioned in lecture as well, was the claim that not one person can master all the knowledge that is needed to be able to decide if climate change is occurring, however they back up their own argument by citing scientists. In other words, every logical attempt they make to deny climate change can also be used to deny their claims.
      <br><br>

One of the things that struck out to me was in the foreword, where the writers suggest "Individual nations should take charge of setting their own climate
       <br><br>
policies based upon the hazards that apply to their particular geography, geology, weather, and culture". This comment angered me because it suggested that if other nations want to believe in climate change, they can take charge themselves, but the big, rich country that is causing the small, poorer nations to suffer can not help them out. Moreover, mass production is one of the ways greenhouse gases are produced, and most of the products that are sold in the United States are produced in other countries, who have to suffer the consequences of climate change.
      <br><br>

Lastly, I found it interesting that you mentioned David Wallace-Wells' article, mostly because I had forgotten how much of an alarmist approach it had taken. In retrospect, I agree that it must have caused a lot of skepticism and a "we're doomed anyway so we shouldn't bother changing our habits" kind of attitude. It's interesting to put them together and see how a convincing argument needs to be made in order to get more people to understand the reality of the threat that is climate change.

<br><hr>
Exactly! It’s alarming how much propaganda they had just to have K-12 teachers teach these kids that the climate change idea is “fake”. It’s these students futures who are going to be affected by what’s happening. If they had this type of propaganda to let students know that indeed the climate is caused by us the people we would have already begun to lower the CO2 emissions. I too found it interesting that the Heartland Institute is the biggest climate denying organization and they published this. Apart from that they distributed it for free to politicians and educators, people who influence the laws and people who educate our youth. I mean it’s a great idea, they know what they’re doing but it’s very upsetting to know that they are doing this. Is money really much more important than the planet, like do they know the money won’t matter if we are all dead? 
      <br><br>
The book also confused me a bit, not in an “I don’t understand” way but in a “damn, this might actually be right” type of way. The structure of it was really well, their points and many sources made me think it’s really credible. They could really easily discredit scientists and people who believe in climate change.  When they brought up the non-scientists, I thought the same thing. But, since I came into it knowing it was a sort of rebuttal towards the scientist who agree, everything they questioned I questioned about them. Like professor Hiltner said in class, most of their sources come from themselves, they are using themselves as sources, how can any of their arguments be taken seriously if they are behind them. The conflict of interest is what I found very interesting and sort of ironic because this is literally them; they are funded by oil companies. They are publishing their own opinions and distributing them, as they are being funded by the oil companies.

<br><hr>
Perhaps it is because I read this book as someone who believes in climate change, but I found the book to unconvincing.  While I understood that the book’s arguments were aimed towards discrediting the arguments made by climate change supporters, I did not really find the explanations the book used to be very convincing.  
      <br><br>
The book stated that the scientists who support climate change can not be sure that their research is actually evidence that climate change exists because these scientists are only experts in one discipline, while understanding something like climate requires someone be experts in many fields.  This argument also applies to scientists that conduct research to prove that climate change is not real, so the book discredits scientists on both sides when it makes this argument.  Furthermore, even if one person is not an expert is all fields, multiple people who are experts in multiple different fields would then be able to exchange data in order to understand climate change.
      <br><br>
The book also states that the reason the research of scientists who believe in climate change can not be trusted is because the researchers were biased in that they already believe in climate change, so they are only looking for data with the assumption that climate change exists.  The book is saying that climate change has not yet been proven, so instead of looking into what exactly the effects of climate change are, we should instead be focusing on finding whether or not it exists.  I find this argument to be weak because to me, most of the research done by climate change deniers was done with the intent of finding data that proves climate change is not real.  If climate change believers are doing research without considering the null hypothesis that climate change is not real, then who is to say that climate change deniers are doing research without considering the null hypothesis that climate change is real?
<br><hr>
I agree that it is crazy how far this misinformation spread by fossil fuel companies has gone, to the point where the public school system has no other influence about the climate crisis than the companies contributing to a large portion of pollution. These companies have a long history of disregarding the importance of public health in the name of profit, so it doesn't surprise me to learn about the ways they continue to brush off how their company practices negatively impact the climate. 

      <br><br>

The ability to convince K-12 teachers that their stance on the climate crisis is quite alarming because from there, it gets passed on to the students. The public school system has a very influential, if not being the main influence, on issues in society and history on children. They have no other choice really but to believe what they are taught in school because especially when they are younger, they don't have any other sources readily available and will take the teacher's word for it.

<br><hr>
It is quite embarrassing to think that this book was literally given away to people of high authority. In other words, people were not going out and personally purchasing these books and showing interest in them, but rather being forced to have the book in their hands. Not only was the content misinformation, but was put into context where the reader may be easily swayed by the material presented. This can especially be the case if the individual reading this did not take into consideration the background of the publisher and authors. Just knowing the background of the central argument of the reading, how can one take this claim seriously? To start, Marita Noon and the Heartland Institute are first of all coming from a conservative viewpoint, and are being funded by fossil fuel companies. 
      <br><br>

I agree with your stance on sending this book to elementary school teachers/classrooms. It seems almost corrupt to me that young children are being targeted and swayed to a point where they grow up with misleading information. The definition of corrupt is “having or showing a willingness to act dishonestly in return for money or personal gain.” How is this not what the authors of this text strove for? It is mind boggling to me how much effort the authors of this book went to to get this book in the hands of influential people, who can and will change several perspectives of those still learning. These teachers most likely do not have the academic background to educate their students on the topic of climate change as well; if the book is trying to say that scientists as a whole do not have the knowledge to make the claim that global warming is real, does that mean no one has the knowledge to make any claim at all? The viewpoints here are quite hypocritical.

<br><hr>

I have the same feeling with you after finishing the reading. K-12 teachers are responsible for educating the children, who are the future of the country. However, if children were taught that climate change is “double-faced”, they would be easily convinced that climate change isn’t real and it doesn’t have great impacts on humans. This is really scary because once people are taught something it is hard to convince them otherwise. 
      <br><br>
On the other hand, I felt creepy and terrified when I realized that people who read this book may not be as educated about climate change as my classmates and I are. The book seems extremely credible as the facts listed were supported by many sources. What’s more, as a student of Engl23, I have no idea on the Heartland Institute before I watch the film and lecture. The institute sounds like an authoritative organization. If I'm almost fooled, what about other readers who don't know anything about the environment? They will be easily deceived by the book.

"History is written by the victors " - Winston Churchill 
      <br><br>

The funny thing about this quote is that with climate change there will not be any victors in the long term. But it seems that the fossil fuel industry only cares about their short term success and the industry as a whole has expended many resources to ensure that the public is not only unable to combat climate change but also unwilling to enact measures to save our planet. I agree that climate change deniers are utilizing the exact same strategies as the tobacco industry when they were placed under public scrutiny. But I completely disagree with your characterization of the book it appeals to our sense of logos but most of the claims within the book are so obviously false I physically cringed. But to those unfamiliar with the subject matter, there is little doubt about the book's ability to persuade them. When fighting a disinformation campaign only cold hard indisputable facts will win the day and the opposition has done a very good job of making even the most basic truths disputable.

<br><hr>

Upon watching the lecture and also reading through the book, I would have to say that I agree with your stance on the misinformed propaganda being a stealthy way in getting the wrong data about climate change out there especially targeting K-12 teachers and other leaders. People specifically children these days are so used to accepting the fact that there are “correct” answers that should be remained unquestionable when a person of authority teaches them something a certain way. I found this very worrisome about the future generations being raised to be unaware about global warming and climate change. Commercials and denialists further provide a link in influencing our perceptions of certain things and like Ken details conservative thinkers are behind funding certain things. The book immediately tries to convince you of set facts by having bullet points of key findings before explaining the chapter. The author tries to argue against the IPCC through diction and uses words like “hypothesis implicit” or “assume” to degrade the severity of climate change statements of the IPCC. Overall, I thought it was blurry in terms of what facts were factual or deniable because it was not resourced through credible sources.

<br><hr>
I agree. It’s sad that climate change deniers are trying to spread misleading information about climate change. To me, no matter if climate change is anthropogenic or caused by nature, it’s a thing that is actually affecting peoples’ daily life. Even if it’s not that harmful today, it will be harmful one day if we don’t prevent it from growing worse now. These fossil fuel companies are simply pathetic as they are trying to save them as much time as they can to make as much as profit they can regardless of what the consequence would be eventually. People tend not to act until they realize something bad is about to happen, and when they realize what is happening, it’s usually too late for them to react. So, It’s better for us to start preventing before a disaster finally comes upon on us.

<br><hr>
I greatly appreciate your comment! It has made me reflect on how the NIPCC has tried to convince people to deny the climate crisis. To be honest, I was a little convinced of their points. Referring to the foreword by Noon, he argues that “They’ve been told over and over again that “97 percent of scientists” believe global warming is a crisis and so sacrifices, even huge sacrifices, are necessary to stop it. (xii)” In the beginning, he rebuts on a common point which climate crisis supporters believe without a shadow of a doubt; this has caused the supporters to lose confidence on their stand. On the other hand, just as you said, the book is structured well and easy to read. In every chapter, there are key points of their argument as well as clear citations of references. Imperceptibly, readers are being convinced that anthropogenic climate change is a misconception. In Ken’s video, he mentions that teachers who are teaching the climate crisis are not sure of this issue. As a result, instructors with only a smattering of the climate crisis can be easily swayed to “educate” the next generation of denying climate change. Thus, we must always engage ourselves in thinking and judging others’ points while reading.

<br><hr>
I strongly agree with you. After reading the article “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I was shocked by the fact that there are people in the world who believe that the climate crisis does not exist even though they see the news and statistics posted online. Behind this scene, education is having a very important responsibility
       <br><br>
I felt terrified when I know the fossil fuel interests’ conspiracy. They used unreliable information to persuade K-12 teachers not to educate the children about the climate crisis. Without a doubt, I think this is a very effective method to maximize profit. Those children are eventually going to become leaders in every field. If schools don’t raise their awareness, no one will stand up against fossil fuel interests to continue damaging the environment in the future. Recalling my middle and high school life, it seemed like I was never educated about the climate crisis as well. As Professor Ken Hiltner said, my school is also one of the climate conservatisms. I hope every teacher in the world should realize warming temperatures could trigger increasingly rapid climate change and educate their students about this situation.
<br><hr>

I agree with your comment that the way they spread disinformation to schools from k-12 is dangerous. The damage from teaching a generation of kids that climate change is not a threat is incredible. This creates a generation of people who will be skeptical of anyone saying that climate change is real, which makes it that much harder to pass climate change legislation. If people grew up not believing it was an issue, it will be almost impossible to convince them that what they have known to be true their whole life is false.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment on the deniers use it as a "propaganda" to the K-12 children during their education. It is a sign that they are creating skepticism among people, which is misleading and not helpful in changing the climate crisis issue. The children believe their teachers, as ken addresses in the video, probably more than their parents. So it is an easy way for those deniers to spread their ideologies; which is also true that many K-12 teachers do not know much about the climate crisis. The K12 teachers have limited knowledge regarding the climate and we cannot expect them to educate children in a meaningful way on the climate crisis, and the teachers have different views.
       <br><br>


And the reading looks reasonable and convincing, but it is also contradictive. What I have been learning or knowing about the climate crisis is different. The data that the book used is quite different than what we know. And its idea of creating an unbiased view is similar to the idea that people who try to let the K12 to educate the children about. Those deniers share the same ideals. Also, the book questions about the experts on climate crisis issues. It makes people start to question the experts as well if the people do not know about the climate crisis issue. However, it is apparent that people can feel the climate change directly through the surroundings or the events took place like the wildfire, etc.

<br><hr>

like you I was absolutely stunned hearing about the propaganda being given to K-12 teachers. Over 300,000 copies of their book are insane. If I was a teacher being sent that book would automatically raise a red flag, I would think, why are they trying too hard for me to read this book and Is it for the purpose that I am a teacher? And your comment about their effort to combat the crisis, HA, if only they would care too. As for the book, I felt very similar to you. The book was particularly organized well, seemed to really push ideas onto the reader. Yet some claims still felt misleading and a bit too pushy, where is where I agree with your point that this book could very much turn readers into skeptics rather than believers. When we first got the assignment I was honestly somewhat excited to hear what the other side had to say, I figured that since the majority of the other side was in politics that they must have some convincing evidence. But in reading, I found absolutely nothing to be convincing, nothing to even be anything that I would call evidence. Was I disappointed? Yeah, but definitely not surprised. Ken if you come across this, you won me, not a doubt in my mind that climate crisis is real, so please can we get to the portion of the course where you tell us how to change.
<br><hr>
I completely agree. It is really frustrating to read and hear about the Heartland institution and other fossil fuel sponsored campaigns that are trying so hard to get this message across to children, as they know that targeting this age group will be a big prediction of how much money the fossil fuel industries will make in the future. It is disgusting to hear that “pollution” is the same thing as “life”. My sister lives in the Bay area but she often goes to China for her job and overlooks the Apple factory production floor. She tells me that the air in China is so polluted that even though she wears a face mask to protect herself, she still believes her life is being shortened everytime she is surrounded by that air. Pollution and these unhealthy levels of carbon in the air are hindering people from breathing normally in their day to day life, and these critics cannot be putting lies into the ears of children, the ears that will continue to make environmentally-destructive purchases if not told differently. And by then, the people who have wrote this publically available PDF will be dead, unaware of how much destruction they left us with, all in the name of supporting the economy that they started, the economy based off fossil fuels that will end us in we listen to what these ignorant people are saying.

<br><hr>
I agree and was also completely shocked that Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming was so convincing in its writing and presentation. Especially when the text emphasized the importance of presenting unbiased information. That really left me shook. It is a lot easier to plant doubt in people's minds than it is to convince an absolute and I think this writing takes advantage of that fact. 
       <br><br>

Presenting both sides of an argument is one thing, but preying on children's minds because they are still developing is purely evil. I think this reveals some of the darkest sides of humanity. The sides where greed, money, and self-gain can lead people to knowingly manipulate impressionable children. Something that also terrifies me is the fact that people who are unsure about climate change can find this publication and become confident in a false reality. You can't even really blame them for trusting "scientists" when the information is that convincing and persuasive. Not everyone has the resources to take a class on the climate crisis or the luxury of time and energy to fact check every detail from a publication. I think it is disgusting that the Heartland Institute preys on this vulnerability and inequality. All we can really do is keep the conversation going and try to fight this injustice.

<br><hr>
I also find it shocking that they are willing to go as far and send 300,000 copies of the second edition of the book to K-12 teachers. What people learn as children, as early as Kindergarten, sticks with them for a long time and for the Heartland Institute to mess with their early education so that they’re even the slightest bit of a skeptic about the issue, it’s disgusting. If climate change is to be taught with an acknowledgment of the side that doubts its existence, then it should be taught that the skepticism, at its core, comes from a selfish conservative view funded by fossil fuels. The book does such a good job at making their goal transparent enough for anyone to read. Like someone has previously said, it’s well organized and easy to follow. It’s too perfect that it can fool anyone if they are not too careful. They list their references after every claim/ section of the chapter, seemingly opening their doors to readers as if to say “we have nothing to hide!” Sometimes they cite their own Heartland Institute. What I found interesting was that a majority of the section spends a lot of time disagreeing with what the IPCC has to say, and yet maybe I’m wrong about this or I might have missed it, but there isn’t a whole lot of evidence on their side to show that climate change isn’t because of humans. Some of their logic makes sense in the way that there’s always two sides to everything, but it’s the only logic that they rely on. When a fact is presented many times through charts and surveys, there has to be a line drawn when denying the truth and outwardly saying that it’s wrong, that climate change isn’t happening.
<br><hr>
I agree with you on how alarming and despicable it is that people dedicate their lives and careers to deceive the public for selfish reasons. I’ve always wondered why the issues causing climate change weren’t taught to children at a young age in schools. Now I know that teachers aren’t even educated themselves on the issues and often teach misleading information to their students. I had no idea that some states were going to the lengths to make laws concerning the skepticism of climate change. It makes me feel as though the Heartland Institute and the fossil fuel industries are winning. Additionally, I was not aware of the fact that the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, was being sent to people for free and particularly targeting teachers and policymakers. All of this information makes it much clearer as to why people are skeptical of the climate crisis. When I was in high school, I started learning about the climate crisis in greater depth and it is a big part of the reason why I chose to be an environmental studies major. I imagine that if I was taught the opposite, such as why the climate crisis isn't real, I would believe it due to my lack of knowledge on the issue. 
       <br><br>

I find it really upsetting that people who were never given the opportunity to learn about the climate crisis are being fooled by the fossil fuel companies. It is just like the issues on public health due to cigarettes. They tricked so many people into believing that cigarettes caused no harm, which lead to many people dying of cancer. These people lie and deceive the public in tragic ways and I am surprised it isn’t illegal for them to do this.
<br><hr>

I completely agree. After listening to Ken's commentary of the book assignment for this week, it concerned me even more than the actual article. Yes, it did surprise me how well this book was written and cited etc, and it was very concerning how seemingly credible the arguments were, but what stood out to me most was the fact that the fossil fuel companies target schools as their main audience for their propaganda. You commented on how methodical this strategy is, and I think the same way. By brainwashing teachers, they are less likely to teach about these important topics in class, leading to both misinformed educators AND schoolchildren.  This serves as just another reminder as to the lengths conservative interest groups are willing to reach in order to keep profiting off of the fossil fuel industry. I also found it very compelling how the same conservative thinktanks that are currently fighting against climate change were, at one point in time, fighting for the tobacco industry. It's crazy to me how, when motivated by money, people are willing to sacrifice both the wellbeing of the american people and the Earth as a whole. 

       <br><br>

Something in relation to the book that really got under my skin was the seemingly strong argument being made. Every section of the book is backed up by multiple cited sources and is remarkably well written. If someone wasn't very educated on the nature of the climate crisis, I would go as far as to say it's believable.



<br><hr>
You hit the nail right on the head. I candidly agree with everything you wrote. For instance, all the companies within the fossil fuel industry have known about the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis for over sixty years now. Now, this is plenty of time to enact in change and factor in the effects of fossil fuels through the change of their operations. I was reading earlier this week about how Exxon has been one of the biggest culprits in misrepresenting and misleading information to the general public. Exxon’s own scientists have been warning the executives for over thirty years, citing that if they were to carry on there could be “potentially catastrophic events”. What really angers me is that rather than alerting the public and taking action, these companies have spent the past few decades spending over millions of dollars into campaigns designed to delay action as seen through the reading. All the while, the science is clear that climate-caused damages have worsened, droughts have intensified, and storms and heatwaves have become so common. On top of this, as seen through last week's readings,  forests have been damaged and wildfires have been occurring and burning through the country. This is beyond despicable.
<br><hr>
Yes, education plays a key role in climate change. In all my years of schooling this is the first time climate change has been taught to me. Last year I had a heated discussion with my psychology teacher because he kept denying the truth about climate change. Even though I lived close by towns that had burned down, flooded, tornadoes have ripped through. People were still not willing to admit climate change is real. So if teachers are going to teach about climate change , they have to be informed first. There has to be another way though because even with all these catastrophic events they still don’t believe. About the book, the amount of times it was mentioned in the book that “97% of scientists believe that climate change is a real thing” is absurd. The author really tried drilling it into your head. That statement kind of confused me since a lot
of the article was based on why scientists didn’t agree with climate change.

<br><hr>
I agree without, after watching Ken's video, I was alarmed by how far fossil fuel companies are willing to go to discredit climate change and the scientists fighting to change the world's view on climate change. It is disheartening to see fossil fuel companies aiming to influence the minds of the younger generation by manipulating them through their school teachers--the one adult figure they have to listen to. Fossil fuel companies will go as far as to deny all claims  that CO2 emissions contribute to climate change because it impacts them when people finally realize the contribution fossil fuel companies have towards climate change over the years. Fossil companies are starting to see the end of the finish line for fossil fuels as the years progress and the general public become more informed and aware of climate change. They choose to deny all claims so they can continue making money. Fossil fuel companies are in the game for the money, not the people.
<br><hr>
I agree with many of the points you made. Particularly, I concur with the idea that if equal effort was put into educating people about the effects of climate change, then we would likely be moving towards a solution. I was also surprised at the fact that so few high school teachers assumed that most scientists would believe in climate change. One would assume that a high school teacher that went to college, and possibly graduate school, would be more informed about these issues; apparently that is not the case, which is quite scary since, as you said, these people are educating our future generations.
<br><hr>
I also agree that their method of sowing skepticism is a big part of what made them believable. They did not sound as extreme or radical as alarmists, making them seem more level-headed and reasonable. It's really frustrating to see how much effort they put into confusing people. These books (and other materials) are full of so much fabricated information. They were created so cleverly and carefully it's disheartening. They definitely look legitimate on the surface. It takes quite a bit of effort to spot the undertones of truth.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that sending propaganda to K-12 teachers is pretty malicious since they are educating our future generations. I agree with Ken that education is one of the most important ways to influence people. I found it  alarming that there is a lack of middle school and high school teachers that believe in the harsh information about climate crisis. I also did not know that 97% of scientists agreed on anthropogenic climate change. I thought it would be lower due to how many politicians discredit climate change even existing. 
        <br><br>
I also found the book to be more enjoyable than I initially thought. Originally, I was alarmed by how many pages there were but I also found it to be well written. I would find this book to be pretty easy to read and clear. There were many different points of views found in regards to climate change. I am also pretty shocked on how easy it is to discredit climate change believers. The people arguing against climate change are a hard opponent to go against. 
        <br><br>
I find it to be very upsetting that fossil fuel companies are sharing wrong information about climate change. It makes me sad that they are giving the wrong information for their own selfish reasons. From the fossil fuel companies perspective, they did a good tactic to target K-12 teachers but I find it absolutely disgusting and borderline evil. I agree with Ken that we must find a way to educate our younger generation with the proper information of climate change. These fossil fuel and other organizations(such as Heartland Institute) have a lot more influencing power than I originally thought. This makes me want to fight even harder to educate those around me on climate change.

<br><hr>
I agree with everything that you said, and it greatly hurts me to read this book that is worded so carefully worded to the untrained eye, it can deceive very easy. The fact that they have distributed this book to countless people who influence our daily lives such as teachers and public officials makes me sick to my stomach. How can a person declare themselves a scientist if they don't look at the facts that their research brings it to. The fact that scientists are split 97 to 3 on the issue and still that 3 percent has a profound impact on the way we view the world just disturbs me.
        <br><br>

While reading this article I found myself not directly, but more subconsciously doubting the facts that I have been taught about the severity of the issue. They bring seemly logical explanations to every question that someone could have about the issue. The biggest problem is that these books have reach more than a third of base line education and if people are taught young that there is no problem, then it will be much more difficult to change their mind later.

<br><hr>

I was likewise appalled that they would send unsolicited copies of this misinformed book to the educators of our nation. They are blatantly targeting children by forcing our teachers to question the validity of climate change. I feel particularly strong about your statement that if they had put half the effort they put into writing this novel to combat climate change, they could have made a hugely positive impact on human kind. It is astonishing that the three chapters I read were practically stating dramatic climate change statistics, and rather than listening and waking up to the facts, the author only tore them apart and flat out denied them. The book said that claims of “scientific consensus” cloud the current debate on climate change, but there should be no debate. Skeptics should not have enough ground to classify this issue as a debate. Action is urgent and questioning the facts we have should not be taking up our nation’s time and energy. 
        <br><br>
The book invalidates the existing sources in a few ways. They claim Oreske’s findings were flawed because a nonscientist cannot determine the finding of scientific research by simply reading abstracts of published papers. They declare abstracts contain claims irrelevant to underlying research as well as exaggerations. The chapter also attacks a survey sent to 10,257 earth scientists because it excludes anyone likely to think the sun or planetary movements have something to do with the climate. It goes on to say scientific accomplishment was not a factor and skeptics would respond the same way alarmists would to the two questions. They also criticize a major statistic that says 97% of climate researchers support the tenets of anthropogenic climate change because it did not include whether or not the researchers thought the warming was catastrophic. All I see in these chapters in unproductive opinions. These are technicalities and if they do reveal that there is more disagreement about climate change than being publicized, so what? This is a desperate time and we should not be focusing on a debate when we should be acknowledging a major threat to society. The Heartland Institute’s actions were also news to me, and it was interesting to discover they were behind this work.

I was also shocked to read how the fossil fuel companies are pretty much manipulating young children.  I wonder why the teachers would teach that it is a two sided argument. This is very concerning. Education is one of the, if not the most important factors in fixing the problem. We need to be educating children at a super young age of the implications of their and everyones actions. There should be school beach cleanups where teachers actually demonstrate how important is to care for the environment. We need people to have direct change in their actions. However, we also need young people to be active in helping the environment. This is because young people will soon be the ones making decisions and in positions of power. We need to forge together, so that once we get in positions of power, we push climate change solutions. I myself have not experienced anti-climate change propaganda in the classroom, however I was also raised in a liberal state. 

        <br><br>

While reading the book, I realized how well formed their argument is. They really thought out how to trick people and take advantage of peoples minds. If it looked legit to me on the surface, as someone in college, the average person could easily be manipulated the these writings. It was scary to read the writing.

<br><hr>
I agree with all of the points you've made in this comment. Particularly the part about how using alarmist rhetoric can alienate skeptics of the climate crisis. Before reading this book, I hadn't thought much about that. I had always just thought that we're at the point where alarmist is how people need to be about the climate. That being said, I can see now how that could cause a greater divide. The last thing people want to hear is other people freaking out about something you're not even sure exists. It seems ridiculous. So the fact that this book used a more medium ground to try to convince that climate change doesn't exist could be something we should be looking at to use in the future. People who are in the middle are more likely to air on the side of caution, which already gives the believers a leg up, but when people start going crazy about it, that's when the divide comes in. It's like people arguing about politics on Facebook; it's absurd and it's not going to change anyone's mind. The way to go about it is by reasoning with the other side. Like you said, acknowledge it. Acknowledge that there's an argument there, rather than trying to make anyone feel stupid, because that's just going to make them dig their heels in more. Nothing creates better ethos than well written, grammatically correct book as well, so they set themselves up well by not just going on a tangent. I think that's some of the issue with climate warriors is that they're overly passionate, and some people just prefer to not get yelled at about everything they're doing wrong in their life.
        <br><br>


The part about how they send this out to K-12 teachers disturbed me as well. Rather than raising kids with general facts and then allowing them to make a decision on their own, it's being drilled into their heads from an early age that climate change doesn't exist. It's not fair to set up the next generation so poorly to handle this mess. With each new generation, it falls more and more into their lap, and if they're brought up to believe it not to be true, then that's setting them up even more for failure. Schools shouldn't be teaching opinions, those should be something people make on their own.
<br><hr>
When I first looked at the reading, it started off with me checking it out. It appeared(!) to be reliable and well-structured, which gave it a very professional and credible feel to it. However, upon actually reading it, I personally found it to be not so reliable. I would say I'm pretty open-minded, but this book just could not sway me in their direction. Maybe it's the fact that I've been in this class for some time now and have been exposed to the more honest and truthful side of the climate crisis, or maybe it's the fact that I just found the writing of these skeptics to not be so believable. However, for the general masses of those who are not as educated on the issue, I can see why this would seem credible to them. Like you said, the rhetoric in this is efficiently utilized in a way that makes their stance and opinion more effective. That being said, like many others, it's shocking to hear that this was sent to teachers nationwide and have this sort of stuff be taught to millions of children. Education of our youngest population is important in their development of ideas and perspectives on different issues, and now they're going to have to grow up with this propaganda etched into their mind. As they grow up, the climate will likely only get worse. How are they supposed to react to and explain all of the natural disasters that will occur in their lifetime? The evidence is quite literally all around them. The Heartland Institute has their own perspectives, and I'll respect the fact that they have those. What I can't see is how someone can still be fed their knowledge, especially in our day and age, when this is a company that tried to discredit the risks of second-hand smoke a couple decades ago. The risks of second-hand smoke is essentially a given in our lives; there's not much debate around that. Overall, the reading did not change my opinion on climate change at all; I still have a firm belief in anthropogenic causes.

<br><hr>

The whole “anti-climate crisis” propaganda that the fossil fuel industries are putting out into the world. There will be a point when we run out of fossil fuel resources they will then realize what they have done to the environment and how grim the future really is. 

        <br><br>

And as for the book itself, it seemed to be very compelling to its argument on why climate change isn't as bad as people say it is. I now understand why there are so many people who believe that climate change is a hoax, as they are in a way “Brainwashed” or “programmed” to think that way.

<br><hr>

I wholeheartedly agree with all your comments. But in particular, I was also shocked that so many conservative think-tanks and "research" institutes put so much effort into misleading the American public and politicians. It's disgusting that the Heartland Institute spreads so much misinformation and straight-up lies about climate change---stuff like that should be illegal. Even more-so that they are distributing these lies to K-12 teachers and essentially indoctrinating young children into believing climate change is false. It's immoral that the only reason they are spreading misinformation is to line the fossil fuel interests' pockets with even more money. After all, if word got out that the fossil fuel companies held responsibility in inducing anthropogenic climate change, fuel sales would plummet. I hate how the conservative rich believe that them gaining more money---even though they all are already rich enough to sustain themselves and more---is much more important than assuring that the planet will continue to be habitable for many future generations to come. Their disgusting greed is going to destroy this world, and it's so disappointing that their actions are going unpunished.
<br><hr>
You make a really great point on the idea that the Heartland Institute, and the publishers of this book, specifically structure their arguments in a way that are both easily-digestible and able to sow that skepticism into people both knowledgeable and not-knowledgeable on the climate crisis. I”ve always thought it relatively preposterous as to why people didn’t believe in climate change, but reading through the first few chapters of this book opened my eyes as to why people deny the effects of climate change. Everything the authors of the book say, every argument they make, they “support” with citations and references that would seem credible and legitimate to the average reader, and especially to young K-12 kids who might not otherwise feel the least bit inclined to research the references that are used. And seeing as how the arguments are also coming from people who seem to be well-educated on the science that goes into climate change and its skepticism, it probably only further helps sway the beliefs an average American might have in regards to climate change because of the legitimacy the arguments seem to have behind them. 
        <br><br>

I also like your idea that this more nuanced approach could work well for exposing people to the reality of climate change. Because it seems to work so well for climate change deniers, certainly it should work vice versa, right? I always thought that climate change wasn’t an issue that should be sugar-coated or beat around the bush in the slightest, that people needed to understand the situation in the dire state that it is. Even though climate change and its effects don’t have to necessarily be “sugar-coated”, I definitely think that a less alarmist approach towards the subject would work to bring in skeptics and help them gradually understand the reality of climate change.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the data about teachers and their teaching of the climate crisis is concerning. I was also surprised how only 30-45% of teachers selected the 81-100% range for the amount of scientists who agree on climate change. Teachers play such a valuable role in the development of kids and their beliefs, so we should strive to make sure they are clear and correct with the information they present. Especially in regards to climate change, as it is a political and disputed topic. The fact that The Heartland Institute mailed 300,000 copies of "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" to teachers across the country definitely makes it come across as propaganda. And, of course, like you said, the fact that The Heartland Institute worked with tobacco companies in the 90s to discredit the risks of secondhand smoke, makes me further question their credibility.
        <br><br>

I also agree with you that the book was pretty convincing in how it presented information. The section that attempted to discredit Oreskes also started to make me question the validity of her study. It is true, as you mentioned, that the rhetoric is effective because it isn't taking a radical position, but rather it is just sowing doubt within the reader. While I do feel that many points made in the book were somewhat of a reach, I would like to see Ken rebuke the book's main arguments this week as well.
<br><hr>
After reading Why Climate Scientists Disagree  About Climate Change, a new window upon the opposition's side on the subject of climate change. To start, I do agree on the fact that the study of the entire Earth's climate is a massive and daunting study, unlike you stated. I believe the Earth's biospheres are incredibly diverse and challenging study, as many scientists and researchers from all spectrums of climate science are needed to identify the climate crisis. There are few experts in the field today that have mastered more than one subject of climate science, and the book uses that as an argument against climate change. However, we must also notice the lack in these experts. While there are a plethora of researchers and scientists that attain mastery for a limited number of fields, I feel that the 'big picture' scientists are very important: They have the ability to gather all the data from many other scientists and make detailed and important conclusions.

<br><hr>
You have a really great way of analyzing the means by which these writers went about postulating their arguments; there really isn't so much of supported facts on their part, but rather influential wording with the hopes of swaying the readers. It's quite easy for us to sweep over their viewpoints, but I can most definitely see where people who are less educated, people misinformed and willing to listen to anything that gives them a pass for their ill-behaviors would so easily believe these skewed, honeyed words. It's so unfortunate that people received these free copies, as some people never would have encountered such rhetoric otherwise and thus never would have come to support such a misinformed belief-system.

        <br><br>

The hypocrisy in this read was honestly just unfathomable. They call out environmentalists for being greedy or exaggerating the truth, when that's the entire basis of the denier's existence. It was informative seeing where the other side is coming from, and perhaps even empathizing with those who don't know any better than to fall to the whim of a fairly well-constructed--yet entirely manipulative--read.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with the points you made. Firstly, I think it is very immoral for fossil fuel affiliates like the Heartland Institute to send propaganda to K-12 teachers and make them unclear about the fact that 97% of all scientists already agree that anthropogenic climate change is real and happening. As a result, 30 percent of K-12 teachers teach climate change as a two-sided argument, and over half of the teachers don’t teach climate change at all. These climate change deniers are very smart to target these educators and utilize school teachers to teach the next generation climate change skepticism. Actually, children are their real targets. Secondly, I strongly agree with you that “imagine if they put the same effort towards combating the crisis”. This organization mailed 300,000 free copies of books to K-12 teachers across the US. It is obvious that they cost a tremendous amount of money and time to do this. If they can put the same effort towards combating the crisis such as improving technology, reducing energy use, and reducing fossil fuel dependence, they will make huge differences. This book is totally different than I thought because it uses lots of studies, surveys, and references to support the author's argument that climate change is not that severe and urgent as scientists claimed. The book is more like a scientific book rather than propaganda. The book is well written and well structured. Even though I already have some basic knowledge about climate change, I was a little persuaded after reading the book. While this book makes me question some ideas regards to climate change, I still believe that climate change is the most severe issue all humans are facing.
<br><hr>
I agree. And this is why I have trust issues! This whole shinannigan is gross. Targeting school teachers to reach children because they know children will fall for should be a crime, it’s a form of brainwashing. Hearing that they targeted school teachers is very unsettling. I think that school teachers do their very best to keep their students up to date on current events. And esepcially since it was distributed so widely in 2017, a lot of the students would, in fact be very aware of climate change and it’s effects. Distributing skewed works in hopes of misinformation around climate change being taught to the youth is beyond not okay. 
        <br><br>

Unfortunately, it doesn’t take a whole lot to convince poeple of things. You see it all the time - covers of magazines falsely claiming pregancies, and then roumers of it go around for months. This is why the distribution of misinformation is extremely important to stop. Expecially with issues surrounding climate change, and especially to the youth, who are ultimately the next generation of people who have to both live with the consequences of climate change, but who also have to try as hard as they can to mitigate the effects before it is too late. It is important that we are teaching our youth about the severity of this situation, so in return we can all start demanding change and truth.
<br><hr>
I heavily agree on what you are saying about the book sowing skepticism/confusion for the reader to start questioning the idea that climate change is real. Not even a few pages in and the book is already making me question "Ok... True, what are scientists REALLY saying?" But I can also see the hypocrisy and irony within the fine lines of almost every page, such as when the author starts talking about "Merchants of Doubt" and how there was no peer-reviewed data or a sense of reasonable data. Yet throughout the book, I felt there was no reasonable or sensible data whatsoever. Another idea that the author seems to be attached on is that alarmist are pressuring us to fear what is not true, yet at the same time they are doing the same thing by sending 300,000 copies to teachers to pressure the kids to think differently. The hypocrisy and irony is just sky-rocketing within this book, and it is shocking how well the author is covering that up.
        <br><br>


But while watching the video, I was honestly furious with the idea that carbon dioxide is a "good" thing. Where is the common sense in that statement? Yes, it is barely understandable on the surface level that "Plants take in what we give them", but once you actually dig deeper into the science behind plants taking CO2, how there is not enough plants to take in all of that CO2 at a rapid speed, how destroying the plants RELEASES that unconsumed CO2 BACK to the atmosphere, AND how the burning of plants just ADDS more CO2 into the air, then you got the wrong idea. It makes me sick when they say "we give them food, they give us life" because they are being hypocritical. If you are preaching that plants and humans are in this tradeoff, why not plant MORE trees and plants? Why not stop all of the construction of buildings and use those acres of land as plant and animal sanctuaries? Why not stop chopping down trees for this excessive amount of lumber? You can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?
<br><hr>
I agree. I really respect the inclusive attitude of the professor Ken Hiltner. The opinions and evidence are sharp and convincing. This will make professor's course more interesting and also more energy-consuming for the professor. There will have more different perspectives in the class. However, this is great for students and for knowledge learning. Everything has different perspectives, most time, there is no right or wrong, there are only different perspectives. After the rational discussion, we will get closer to the fact, the truth. 
        <br><br>


The article clearly shows up the opinion of why scientist disagrees about global warming. Both agree and disagree side have good, reasonable views, but the evidence of the views is controversial. For example, data is good evidence to use, but, for environmental issues, the effectiveness of the data is questionable. The recorded data is too little, the earth is too old. Thus, the changing of temperature can be normal or dangerous depends on the time span of the data.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your statement. I think that climate change and the knowledge of it starts with the younger generation. The fact that this propaganda is influencing and impacting children from the information they learn from their K-12 teachers is extremely disheartening. Action begins in the minds of the young and the fact that the companies would go to such lengths to misguide children before they are even able to start developing their own opinion on matters upsets me. Teaching the younger generation that climate change is not a real threat will impact how they treat the environment- which is the environment and world that they will grow up in, even when the fossil fuel companies are no longer around/alive.
<br><hr>
I agree I was surprised how fossil fuel industries are putting their support behind books that discredit the climate crisis for their benefit. It's concerning that the young generation is being exposed to a one side of the argument and are not being taught the whole picture because of this. The survey I think was very biased because only certain scientist were chosen for the survey and the data was not gathered from a large pool.

<br><hr>

I think it’s kind of amazing the extent to which oil companies will go to preserve their interests, especially in regards to actions that don't just have an impact now, but will forever change the way that we see the world and the way in which we live in it. However, I am not surprised. The easiest way to make people question something that no one wants to believe is true, is give them a semi-probable, easy to accept an excuse to not have to believe that we are causing climate change. Wouldn't it be easier if you didn't have to believe that every time you drove your daughter to work, you were making a mark on the planet; to not have to think about where your food comes from, or feel guilty about flying to go somewhere on vacation? Its a lot of work to address the way your daily life would have to change to prevent the catastrophe that we are creating. It's not so hard to get someone on your side if you give them a way to absolve them of their guilt. This book was perfectly written to do just that.
<br><hr>

I agree that it is, as you put, insidious that fossil fuel interests are influencing and perpetuating further confusion in K-12 teachers. It really goes to show how far people will go to protect their wealth. The degree of selfishness and utter stupidity that is present in the climate crisis is astonishing. Fossil fuel interests need to be held accountable for the damage they are wreaking on society and on the world. I found the section where you stated that "imagine if people put the same effort towards combating the climate crisis" to be something I've wondered during the past three weeks of this course. It is crazy to think about how much money and man hours go into misinforming so many people about the climate crisis. Imagine the amount of progress we could be seeing in renewable energy. Its astounding. 
        <br><br>

The book was well-written, like you stated. However, I did not find the arguments of the book as convincing as some of the other comments on this video suggest. If you take the claims and evidence at face value all of the arguments seem to stand up and hold make you wonder is the climate crisis actually a threat. However, if you read into or think about the claims the book provides you will see they are not actually strong and they use well written English to come off as convincing by hiding misleading information behind a bunch of statistics that hold little to no correlation to real problems being caused by the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I agree with you about targeting teachers and the students they are teaching. Not to mention how badly things have been done to people and the newer generations, just the fact that the newer generations are taught that the global warming or climate crisis, in general, is not real, at least it is not caused by human action but natural disasters may bring some obstacles of saving the planet. Even though it might not be true, but it is still hard to imagine that we, the generation that was not taught climate crisis was not true, are the only group of people that fighting for a better environment. The problem, now people are facing, is that whether there is a way of changing the minds of teachers who are still doubting that climate crisis is real. I wonder what we could do just to change that the way that the students are taught about the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment. What struck me the most was how you point out that targeting people with misinformation was no easy feat and to imagine if they put the same effort towards combating the crisis. It is appalling to me that these fossil fuel companies and people in general are driven by wealth to maintain their high standard of living when none of these materialistic items will matter when the world is destroyed by us with our current consumption. 
        <br><br>

It is terrifying how easily people can sow doubt about climate change through this book. I also believed that the book would take a more radical stance before reading. However, I found myself slowly questioning data before I caught myself in the act. In the video, Ken mentioned how these books are mass produced and sent to K-12 teachers who teaches the younger generation. You mentioned, the book was easy to read, clearly cited, well-structured, and well-written. This may be calculated on the authors’ part so that it is easier for educators to explain that stance to the younger ones in our generation who are more easily influenced, especially by those in a respected position.
<br><hr>

I agree with you. It is shocking that these fossil fuel interests use methods and tactics to mitigate the seriousness and truthfulness of climate change. Their tactic of sending copies of their book to K-12 teachers is indeed insidious. It is a good tactic because they are presenting their argument to some of the main influencers of this young generation. I personally never had any teacher from K-12 that spoke about climate change not being real. Although it hasn’t happened to me, I can still imagine how persuading it can be for a teacher to spend time out of class to tell you how fake climate change is. They are being really smart with this, but as you said it would be better if they were this smart towards combating the climate crisis. 

        <br><br>

I also agree with you on the book being well written. The book does present its argument clearly. All of their main points from the reading are clearly listed and are easy to read for the common reader. Despite this, I began to question their argument as soon as I read the “Key Findings” before chapter 1. These key findings state that the IPCC is a political body not a scientific body. I found this to be a dumb argument because the IPCC was started by the United Nations, so that is basically claiming that the UN is agenda-driven as well. Another thing noted in the key findings is that “Climate scientists, like all humans, can be biased. This is a weak argument because the scientists on their side of the argument are humans as well (obviously),  so this argument can be used against them as well.

<br><hr>
I absolutely agree with this comment. The book was more conniving to me than I thought. It was well structured like you said. They were straight to the point which makes it easy to read. Most people don't want to dig for an article to get information, this book feeds you that information like bait. But if you look deeper into the book and actually think about the things they are saying, you find flaws. Again, I agree with what you said, you can questions the credibility like the non-scientist appearing to have credibility. It's crazy to think that they are trying to educate the youth with this information. Kids aren't given the opportunity to learn what we college kids learn. They are barely learning basic math equations or simple sentence structures. Why on earth would they want to educate kids who aren't being given the full story and points of views from all sides. They are targeting the youth because they can manipulate them at an early age. It sucks to watch because you know the truth and the truth isn't being told.

<br><hr>
I am just as appalled as you are at the effects of fossil fuel companies preying on the young minds of this country by sending out copies of their book to K-12 schools.  They are trying to get kids to learn from a young age that there is no Climate Crisis and fossil fuel are doing nothing to harm the environment.  I also found it very interesting that more than half of teachers didn't even get in the ballpark of the 97% consensus.  Many of those teachers are the ones that found no issue in reading the book "debunking" climate change.  I found myself feeling the same way when I read the pages of the books.  I went into knowing my stance on Climate Change and thinking " There is no chance I'm going to be swayed because of one piece of literature", but here and there I found myself struggling to disagree and it made start questioning things I felt sure about before.  It is subtle in the way it attacks Climate Change and that is part of what makes it so effective.  I am with on Ken giving us refutal points on the issues brought up in the book because if I am being honest I have no idea how I would.

<br><hr>
I agree with your comment above. It was very wise of these companies to target school teachers especially K-12 and to try to convince children that climate change isn't real. What they are really doing is breeding the next era of skeptics. This is a smart move on the denier's behalf, not the right move, but a smart move. the longer these companies keep the skepticism alive the longer their companies will flourish and profit. So starting with elementary and high schools is the most efficient way to do that.
        <br><br>

The book was also remarkably well written, especially for a book by people who are so blatantly wrong. It is a convincing book, no I was not swayed in my knowledge of the climate crisis, but that is because I know the actual truth and what Ken has taught. But if you were decently uninformed and had little understanding of what was going on I can see how this book might seriously convince you that humans did nothing to assist in the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
As we have learned in the film before, people are can be persuaded into causing doubt when it comes to climate change and whether it is a hoax or not. Along with the reading it just adds onto it. I agree with your statements and it seems as things are made so easy for people to read a biased article without noticing. Although it comes off as credible, much of what is stated does not reflect the scientific accuracy of climate crisis. By influencing one person, it sets off a chain. In this case with the teacher, once one portrays their opinions onto children, there really is no going back. I think it is primarily crazy that that only 97% of scientists believe in climate change is real and the reason this is astonishing is because these are things that are proven based on facts and observations. Although it is still a high number of scientists, there has now come a divide on fact and belief.
<br><hr>
I agree that it is extremely alarming how much K-12 students are being influenced by climate change denial. For a long time, I wondered how anyone could believe that the climate crisis is not an issue when the facts appear overwhelming and most critical analysis would find books like "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" lacking. However, in my head, I always envisioned adults unwilling to accept that their life may need change and instead choosing to cling to the belief that they have done nothing wrong and do not need to do anything differently. Instead, I learned that children too young to question the information given to them by trusted sources like their teachers are often the ones being taught about climate change denial. It is not only disturbing that children are being indoctrinated but also that so many teachers are affected as well. Teachers need to be well educated and you would think that they would research facts before presenting them to their students. Instead, only 30/45% of middle school/high school could identify 81-100% as the range that contains the percentage of scientists who agree on climate change being real (when the real number is 97%). It scares me how powerful this disinformation campaign is throughout the country. 

        <br><br>

Reading this book allowed me to glimpse the reasoning behind many climate change deniers. While I found many fallacies in the book, if not read too critically many of the arguments seem reasonable. As you said, the book does not go to extremes and say that all claims of climate change are made up, it merely tries to make you skeptical enough not to believe in a consensus. I believe this logical fallacy is related to "bothsidesism," also known as "false balance." This is the logical fallacy where two opposing viewpoints are given equal weight even if the facts clearly favor one side. This book tries to appear as though it is merely presenting the other side of the argument about climate change, which makes it seem as though both sides are equally valid. However, factually the existence of climate change is not in doubt at all, and presenting this denial does not change the facts. I hope that there is a way to make people believe in these facts rather than the opinions of those funded by fossil fuel companies.
<br><hr>
I have to admit that it was pretty smart of The Heartland Institute to spread their book to K-12 teachers, as Ken pointed out theoretically it could reach 10 million children in the U.S. Unfortunately, the goal of the Heartland Institute is to spread misinformation on the climate crisis. This is an absolutely horrible thing that the fossil fuel companies are doing to brainwash children. 
        <br><br>


From the reading I also learned that 97% of scientists agree on anthropogenic climate change, which is slightly higher than I had assumed it would be. I also found the book to be overall very well written with arguments that seemed to be supported with some kind of evidence. I can see how the book may seem credible and convince some readers as there are many citations that appear to be from reputable sources.

<br><hr>

I absolutely agree with this comment, I was too frightened by how easy it was to brainwash readers to believe in the invalidity of climate change. It brings to mind the idea that the pen is mightier than the sword. Language has a way of yielding power over people. The things we as students learn from our textbooks become law, as the material we are taught is often argued to be the hard truth. This book has really reminded me that there are more than one truth to each person, and this doesn’t necessarily need to be reliant on actual facts but rather the way facts are presented. The Heartland Institute, who published this book, are also funded by Exxon Mobil. This gives the a bias to support a claim that argues against the validity of climate change. And because textbooks are supposed to exemplify educational facts, the students of these classes are brainwashed into supporting biased information. It is incredibly frustrating, because these instillations of climate attitudes in young minds will be carried into adulthood. Like with learning a language, it is harder to become fluent as you become older. It is the same idea with attitudes about climate change. If people are educated in the idea that it isn’t real at an early age, it will be hard for them to relearn and gain a new idea of how human actions are effecting the planet.
<br><hr>
I am in strong agreement with what you have posted. I think that the root of the issue of being skeptic about the climate crisis is not they are really being skeptic, but the founding behind it. The capitalistic system made it hard to change or to challenge the whole benefit group. Like the anti-Vaccine scientists, the capitalists paid them to spread the information that vaccines will lead to autism. 
        <br><br>
Also, I feel deeply realized that the counter of the problem is education because if you take a paper to normal people with "authentification" that it is from a scientist, they will be believing even more about what they have already believed. Only education can improve the identification of the seriousness of the issue.
<br><hr>
I agree. The book is written in a seemingly scholarly way. It provides the information in a way that may cause anyone to question what they believe in. There was no radical criticisms or denial that would turn an average person away in disgust, but enough facts and evidence to plant seeds of doubt. The subtle attacks at questionable or ambiguous findings and cherry-picked data could easily sway a fence-sitting individual. 
        <br><br>
Their efforts are commendable, as it is clear they did their research. But I cannot stand the fact that they used this as propaganda towards teachers and young students. The fossil fuel industry are simply putting forth a facade to mislead the public and question science. All because they want more money, and have the money to do so.

I can’t believe that so many Americans still think that climate change is a hoax, but I understand why that’s the case. “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” was an extremely well-written piece of climate denier literature. At first glance, the article even tricked me a little. I caught myself reading certain sentences over and over again because they were so convincing. It is important to not believe everything you read and to check the sources. The article is filled with sources from The Heartland Institute, a well-known conservative think tank. Climate deniers are selfish. They’re dangerous because they get into the minds of important people such as politicians and teachers and make them question the validity of climate change. If we want a change of survival, people need to band together and prioritize sustainable options. That’s not what climate deniers want, though.

Taking the issue of climate change and manipulating it to emphasize advocacy for skepticism was the main objective of the Heartland Institute. With teachers and students being the main targets for this operation, the course of climate change is swayed in a negative direction. Children being raised with the established standard that climate change is a myth shows little hope in the future generation continuing to fight against the destructive elements. In looking at the manuscript crafted by seemingly accredited climate change skeptics, the arguments that are crafted appear to be frighteningly convincing. The rebuttals against numerous studies specifically pinpoint areas of confusion by questioning the credibility of sources and rearranging logical explanations for their benefit. I do not approve of this practice like many other people, but in the face of large corporations and the world they dominate, I will strive to bring climate change forward as a legitimate issue that must be handled now.

This book talks about the climate crisis in complete different way as it denies the human effect on the crisis. The author is trying to convince the reader that the consequence of the climate crisis is not like what we commonly know. It is true that scientists could be biased, but the phenomenon that happened in current century can’t be biased though. It’s undeniable that all of the consequence happened after how human largely used up the resources in the world. The author mentions that “the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), created to find and disseminate research finding a human impact on global climate, is not a credible source,” however, whether or not this claim is right or not, it is still unchangeable that human played a significant role in the climate crisis.

I find it a bit disgusting that there are people in the world who are actively trying to confuse the younger public.

It’s sad to see someone trying to spread misinformation for the sole purpose of them trying to maintain their economic positions.

"Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming" is completely and utterly despicable. The author and those backing it are as well. Big fossil fuel industries funded this false narrative. Also, it is maddening that the book directly aims to target the most vulnerable—children the future of our planet. 
        <br><br>

The spread of false information such as “no convincing relationship has been established between warming over the past 100 years and increases in extreme weather events” is quite dangerous and impactful to adults let alone children. By denying the climate crisis with half-truths and distorted evidence this book does a great disservice to the people of the world.

it is funny to believe that such accusations are being made. These are actual scientists creating a sense of false hope to the public that it is not possible for man made climate change to be real? It baffles me due to the fact that there are facts and real live events taking place right before our eyes and for them to say that willingly. It hurts me because these so-called educated scientists are the ones who are supposed to be the one believing, not the skeptics. They are the ones that give us that sense of hope we need while the destruction of Earth is happening right before our eyes. To think they are actually taking the time to come up with details on why it is not true and arguments on why to believe it is not true. Saying that there is not enough evidence to support that climate change is actually real. To me that seriously sounds like a joke.  They should think twice and argue with people in which were severely affected by climate change. Lives have been lost, individuals livlihood destroyed. For them to come to an actual consensus on why it is not real is essentially disrespectful.

It is crazy to think that as many of 30% of K-12 teachers teach both sides of the argument of global warming and more than half do not teach it at all. Global warming should be taught at every school and should even create a class like Ken's ENGL 23 in K-12 schools. The article "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming"  really shows how much climate science is overlooked. It also shows the corruption of fossil fuel companies who would probably do almost anything to help not publicize climate change and get out the word that 97% of scientists disagree with climate change and think it is "man-made". Those opposed taking action to curb climate change have engaged in a misinformation campaign to deny the existence of expert consensus. However, even if the consensus number is 50% or 100% I believe that people would not forget about their views and most likely would not advocate for the unrestricted burning of fossil fuels. Overall, the main solution is to be educated and let everyone know what is really going on with our planet.

I think that its real bold of the people writing this book to argue against the 97% of scientists that believe that climate change is real. When Marita Noon said, “Surveys show the American people put climate change at the very bottom of lists of problems they want the government to address”, it really bothered me that the percentage of the people that were surveyed was not included in that sentence. I know that a lot of people would want the government to address climate change as they think it is very important. This also brings to mind the demographics of the people who vote in elections. Majority of the people who vote are 60+ years old and belong to the group of people who added on to climate crisis. If they were ignorant to the effects of it then and believe that it isn’t a big problem now they aren’t going to want the government to address it so there will be no changes and soon there will not be enough time to act.

Targeting children and manipulating them into denying the existence of human caused climate change is terrible. However, the barrier to this kind of thing happening should be the teachers. If teachers are teaching their students that humans have no effect on climate change, then they shouldn't be teachers. Education in the US is notoriously terrible, and part of this is because of bad teachers. We need to be paying teachers better wages to attract better teachers. Also, teachers unions protect bad teachers from losing their jobs, which, they should if they are teaching climate change denial.

This book was very frustrating to read knowing that the Heartland Institute is funded by fossil fuel supporting corporations such as the Koch Brothers as well as general motors. Despite discussing how many “alarmists” were biased based such as careerism, political views and grant seeking it is ironic that the Heartland Institute fails to address their very own biases. 
        <br><br>
In addition, I found it disturbing to see how easy it is to believe every piece of information which makes the general public and teachers more susceptible to accepting this information as fact. With this being the case it is unfortunate because the younger generation needs to be taught about climate change. They should be aware of what is going on and how they can make an impact. Like Ken stated in previous videos one way of mitigating climate change starts at conversations at the dinner table.
        <br><br>
While reading this piece I also was angered at climate change being portrayed as a political issue. Knowing that it is not a political issue and by saying that it is just misleads people which is why I can see how easy it is for big politicians to not address climate change leaving the public to believe that it must not be an important issue. When in reality they are just hiding important information to the youth who will be affected most by climate change.

There are over 97% of scientists who believe the fact of climate change. That shows that there is a lot of proof shows that climate-changing is happening around us. The fossil fuel companies argue that K-12 teachers are overwhelmed. The company like Heartland Institue fund campaigns that educate the public that climate change is n not true. They would rather denote money to that useless propaganda than spending money on reducing emissions. 
        <br><br>
And the book shows that most of the books that denying climate change are mostly funded by the fossil fuel industry. 
        <br><br>
Moreover, those fossil fuel companies target K-12 teachers and make those free online. Such a clever action. After receiving that information, the K-12 teacher would distribute that information to the kids. And the kids will change their attitudes toward climate change. They deny and refuse the fact that our planet is on changing. When the kids grow up, they will still consume fossil fuel and provide profits for fossil fuel companies.

<p>

When I read the first paragraph, I scoffed at the bold claim that the climate crisis is man-made, which 97 percent of scientists agree is wrong. The article immediately cast doubt on the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) and the ngo international panel on climate change (NIPCC). Even after admitting that prominent agencies such as NASA had posted the statistic on their websites, they still publicly claimed it was wrong. To be honest, to me, it was a joke and the article had no idea what was in front of them. In many cases, the article claims to be an unqualified scientist, but the same may be true for the author of the article. The only contribution this article makes to my view of the climate crisis is that the other side of it is starting to sound even more incredible.
        <br><br>
When I watch Ken's video, I start to get a little angry because kids are being targeted and they're going to think climate change is no big deal when it's actually a big problem. The shocking number may be 10 million children who do not realize that the earth is slowly dying and drastic measures may be needed to save it. The problem we have as a society right now is that we don't want to admit that there is a global problem, and we spend time trying to convince people that there isn't. We must come together as a whole and begin to look at this problem together in order to do something, or we will lose our planet in ignorance.

I am in just shock after reading this document. I cannot fathom to believe that this was published and was read by other people. I read the introduction to the document at first and I kept rolling my eyes because I already know this is just crazy that they’re dragging this narrative when they know climate change is a real predicament. As I was reading, I came across the NIPCC, which in my head I thought “that’s funny, I thought there was only an IPCC,” and so once I did my google search I came across the website and thought they had to be joking. I searched through the website and could not help but notice a few things: there were was only a team of four scientists listed, most of the people on the website either worked at the Heartland Institute or came from another conservative think tank, and none of the claims they were making had any research to back them up; they were not even doing their own research. One of the scientists was Joseph Blast who wrote an article and did research on the climate and I did a quick google search on him and found on Wikipedia that he studied Economics at the University of Chicago where he later dropped out to work for the Heartland Institute, so I am just wondering where does the climate research part come in. It is disheartening and scary to think that there are people giving out information when they clearly do not study it and are challenging those who lives revolve around this.
        <br><br>


I want to become a teacher after College, an environmental studies high school teacher in particular and so I am fearful that I would be forced to teach what I know best. (I would still teach what is right and what I have learned.) I can not imagine the hundreds of thousands of students being taught this. I just cannot believe that bills are being passed to let this happen knowing that is jeopardizing everyone's future. It makes me so sad. 
        <br><br>


The “refutes” and claims they make through the entirety of the document do not seem to include sources that backup their claims. When you look at the sources they are arguing that climate change is occurring, yet they make it seem like it is for their side. Others are in support of them (which were written by the Heartland Institute itself,) but this particular link was not working and so you cannot even see the evidence that backs up their claims. As Ken mentioned, these papers were carefully written to make it seem like the science is still debated or is in fact wrong. They even attack people’s work and credibility such as Naomi’s Oreskes over small details. I hope for the future that the lies will eventually be drowned out by the truth.

Education is so important for global warming. Like previous lectures claim, the generation of ours is affected by global warming the most. But children even cannot know the true information about global warming. In the survey, the number of teachers who can choose correctly does not exceed half. Who can be responsible for the disinformation of children. Nowadays, many scientific institutions are funded by fossil fuel companies like Koch brothers. But Marita Noon does the thing other people cannot do. He shows the truth about climate change to everyone for free including children. People should aware that the climate change is caused by human activities. So we have the ability to slow down it.




</p><hr>



<p>
After read "why don't scientists agree on global warming", I am kind confused, because there are many facts and figures about climate change, but many of them are proved to be unreliable because of the statistics of bias and non-credibility sources. Also, after reading this article, I have the opposite view about it. Because everything can be a double-edged sword. Once it has something positive to show people. There must be people who are not satisfied. Therefore, we cannot let educators take the responsibility of educating students in a way that the author thinks is wrong. First, we should let people know the current situation of our environment. Like global warming, educators need to educate students about the facts of the environment. We don't need to let students know what to do or force them to do.

I would have to admit one thing that, at first glance, this book seemed credible for me because of its layout. It's structured in a very scientific style of writing. It definitely used a lot of numbers and quotes to make it seem very reliable in some sense. But after reading some of it, I started feeling like "Hmmm, is that actually a little bit too much?". Firstly, they're trying to disprove the statements made by IPCC about human caused climate change. But their statement seemed not credible for me because they are kind of just looking for numbers that are not so powerful to disprove it. They try to say things like "60% of the scientists didn't clearly agree with this in their science article" or "Oreskes isn't a scientist, then the summary he gets from reading abstracts of scientific journals are not credible". They're trying to convince people, but they did simply too much of it. Another impression of mine is the number of references they used for this book. Almost every three pages there will be one page full of references. As for me, this seems very forced-like. It's weird because most people don't include such number of references in scientific articles. Surprisingly, this becomes a point where some readers find it trustworthy! The top comment of this book on Amazon mentioned the tons of references it used make it credible, which is totally unreasonable for me.

        <br><br>

Also, as someone has heard of it before, the organization mentioned in the book is just a joke. "Global Warming Petition Project" is just a paper signed by people who are not real scientists but people with interests from oil companies instead. This book trying to draw attention to this organization and saying it's valid is just a laughable act for me.




</p><hr>



<p>
It's certainly hard not to be swayed by this book as it is very well written and seems credible from first glance, but just to think that children are becoming the target of climate skepticism propaganda is preposterous. It's one thing to fool adults, but to target the naïve is entirely absurd. This book made me doubt myself, and realizing that it had the power to do that on an individual who is majoring in environmental studies made me see the power that they hold against all of us. Knowing this made me feel a fire rise within me to fight back because we cannot allow fossil fuel industries to deceive our future generations any further. These children have little to no exposure to the crisis we are currently experiencing, and to blind them with false information is terrible. They deserve to know the truth, and we need to do better to ensure that they do know the truth about the climate crisis.

I believe that I am capable of looking at both sides of an argument and that it can actually help people understand the topic more, but I don't think Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming would really help anyone. It was meant to confuse people so that they were not confident in choosing a side. Even those who were confident in their position on climate change may be swayed by this reading due to the writers’ skills in persuasion; citing what seem to be reliable sources and showing a lot of what can be interpreted as facts. Learning that 300,000 copies were sent to teachers across the U.S. is infuriating. Those responsible for that idea achieved what they wanted to do and severely damaged the number of people who believed in anthropogenic climate change. 
        <br><br>
When first learning this, I was glad to think that my schools never talked about this book before realizing that Ken is right on another point: I was never seriously taught about climate change. The only teacher that I can think of that ever talked about it was my astronomy teacher in my junior year of high school and that was because he was a very dedicated climate activist. I’m glad that I took it upon myself to do research on climate change when I was younger. 
        <br><br>
Hopefully, those students who were taught the perspective portrayed in Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming will do the same before they decide to side with climate change deniers.

This world is a beautiful place. But after watching the video, it seems that it is much more complex and tricking than I thought. 
        <br><br>

Reading into the book was exactly what I expected since Ken reminded us that we could fell a little for what the book has to say in class. Indeed, the book was well-written, the facts and examples provided were cogent and coherent. The writer knew very well how to word his stories to boost his credibility. But I think there’s more than just simply calling Heartland Institute wrong.
        <br><br>

Since we live in such a big world, things are always two-sided. After reading, I can’t help to ponder and question my past beliefs. I know that anthropogenic is real and undeniable, but I also believe in the inevitability of fate. This ship has sailed and there’s not much we can do to change its course. I believe that the ending is set and no matter what we do we cannot change anything about it. Even if the Heartland Institute gets torn down and disassembled, there will always be climate change deniers trying to spread their ideas, this is just the nature of the human mind—free will. We are all just a pawn in the game.

This was an interesting response. While it is true that there will always be two sides to an argument, especially one as controversial as this one, I would dare to say that there is a third opinion to climate change that is most affected by books like these and the heartland institute. You got your climate change activists, your deniers, and then you have your moderates who are on the fence about climate change and could be easily swayed by propaganda like this. To the layperson, it would be easy to believe in both sides of the argument because science is more or less magic to those who don't spend their whole life studying it. 

        <br><br>

To me, your comment sounded very pessimistic. Rightfully so. This class has, thus far, only given us the bad and then asked us to fix the mistakes of the past generations. But when I look at books like "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" I just think of it as a move on a chess board. At this point, it seems like its whoever can get the most support on the issue wins. The oil companies have a big lead, but the game is far from over yet.

"Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" opened my eyes to the power of evidence and how one can be swayed by the sheer statistics that are presented in front of them. While I do believe that a vast majority of the climate change that is taking place is anthropogenic, this reading still made me question my own beliefs and what the class is teaching, just like Ken said that it might. The authors that wrote the book did a good job by providing several references from the arguments they make and accompany it with their evidence. The use of statistics and citations is powerful in showing the reader that their points aren't just coming from thin air, but are widely believed within the community and are supported by others. The main argument that the book makes is that it is invalid to say that their is an "overwhelming consensus" between the community of scientists because most scientists disagree on the causes and consequences of climate change. Because of this, the issue is said to be oversimplified. The Heartland institute is targeting students who were sent this book, a whopping 300,000 copies to k-12 teachers all across the country. With a subject like this, it is easy to be swayed one way or another by how credible the source seems, and the authors do a good job with their overwhelming statistics and references. This has dangerous consequences as a whole new demographic could become in denial of the climate crisis, backtracking on any progress made.

The topic of climate change alone feels intangible to the average person, and I feel that "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" takes heavy advantage of this confusion. With such a broad topic to be covered, statistics and data are thrown around willy nilly, and it's overwhelming to try to vet each and every source. Such an argument can be made today, what with Fox News and their "fake news". The arguments made against opposing news outlets doesn't necessarily completely counteract the facts presented, but rather clouds the vision of the viewer, and creating skepticism. It is the same with this book. The author simply tries to discredit the studies done by other researchers by saying that there wasn't a representative sample, or the abstracts were misleading, etc. The way that this book is constructed intended to create skeptics and offer sources to build that skepticism on, through citations and bland statistics.

After reading this book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I found that many facts mentioned in this book with well structure and citation are kind of undeniable which even let me doubt myself about my opinions on anthropocentric climate change. That makes me worry about other readers' feelings. And what is the worst is that they are sending propaganda to K-12 teachers, who are teaching many students that have had no clear perceptions of climate change and global warming yet. It will lead to unawareness of this serious climate issue of a whole generation and generations to come, then irreversible destruction on our living environment.  And as Ken said, the Heartland Institute is badly typical of this kind of action, which targeted to distortion of new generations' perception of climate change. Anyway, I think we should stick to slowing down anthropocentric  climate change and do not be directed wrongly by inaccurate knowledge.

Scientists though global warming is not existing which is unbelievable for me with such terrifying data and evidence to support how climate change is affect the globe and the whole ecology system. Although scientists believe climate change could be anthropogenic stage happens in the human history. However, such rapid climate change did not leave an enough time for species to adapt and evolve. From the lecture, the result of the global climate models was supported by most climate scientists. 
        <br><br>
I would say policymakers might rely on what they claimed as professional advice of climate change and still view climate change as a minor treat or even an inevitable process in human revolution. But the truth is independent, nongovernment organizations and scientist have leverages into this topic. Based on personal perspective, climate change causes severe changes in previous course materials. Extremely climate events might reaching to us shortly if there is not action taken.

I believe the most important reason is that those scientific researches are fund by fossil fuel company. And everyone knows that the major causes of climate change are leads by the usage of fossil fuel, as using fossil fuel will release greenhouse gases, and greenhouse gases lead to climate change. Those scientists who state there is no climate change is funded by those fossil fuel companies. Then how can those researches be accurate? Therefore, I don't believe any of this research and I strongly agree with what Ken talked about in the video. Also, we should learn more about climate crisis and starts to protect our planet.

I hold same opinion with you. Those researchers are supported by fossil fuel companies. They deny the true reasons of climate changes and insist that climate changes are largely caused by solar activities. Maybe this is partially true, but compared to Fossil fuels companies, solar activities have far less influence in climate changes. Burning fossil fuels will cause a huge amount of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere which make the planet warm quickly. Those researchers are engaging in a profitable corporation with fossil fuels companies. Corruption among scientists cannot be ignored. According to the reading, CO2 does not cause to much to global warming. I am shocked when I see these words from professional researchers. I do not believe these researchers, and I will keep protecting the environment by reducing greenhouse gas releases.

The book "Why scientists disagree about global warming" shows me an ironic insight that the credibility of the scientific data and evidence can be denied by non-scientists. These non-scientists have a large population, and they are usually influential to the society. Although the book states that 97% of scientists agree with the statement that the climate change is caused by human actions, the author of the book uses clever words to convince the readers that global warming is not caused by human activities and it has no much negative effect to their life. I feel shock and angry first towards the book because it ignores the scientific data and evidence which built by scientists who spent their time and efforts on research. Later, I realizes that the book leads me to see the opposite side of the arguments that related to the climate change. The book does not deny the existence of the climate crisis, instead, it emphasizes the climate crisis is not significant. Without any evidences proven, the book just repeats its arguments. The book is open to the public, so everyone including K-12 teachers and children is able to access it. The book leads a wrong education to these kinds of non-educated readers and builds a wrong general idea for them. They may approach the problem of climate change with ignorance in the future because they accepted the wrong message from the book. It will be sad that climate crisis and scientific evidence beyond are not paid attention.

Many of the students in this class went into this reading already knowing the ill intentions of the book. I think we were particularly nit-picky of its rhetoric and however convincing and structured the argument against the “97% consensus” of climate change was made, we have a filter which we were able to screen out most of the fallacies. What is scary is that people who are not as aware of where “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming” came from and who was responsible for funding it may be more easily persuaded by the report. On the surface it seems like a cohesive report disproving the consensus on Anthropocene climate change, and this could easily fool someone that may not have background knowledge of the climate crisis. It is a malicious, but successful attempt at creating doubt and confusion in the public eye about whether climate change is a pertinent issue. The goal of the Heartland Institute is just this: to cause hesitancy. The longer people feel that climate change science is still disputed, the longer that people will wait to take any action, and the longer that fossil fuel affiliates continue to frack, drill, and destroy our earth for money. It is often said that liberals have politicized climate change, but it is quite the opposite. Conservatives have forced another “side” to climate change to avoid taxes and to allow for an expanding free market. The progressive side of climate change wants to avoid complete destruction of earth, earth’s resources, and future generations; but climate change deniers have continually revealed themselves to have private interests in fossil fuel industries and ill motives for muddling the crisis at hand.

The circumstance is caused by the skills which are similar to the strategies people use in debates. When a person is at one side, he tends to tell partially truth and delivers only partial information to the judge, since judge is the only one that is going to decide whether you can win instead of convincing your opponents. In this situation, books which teachers’ read deliver information which are correct but inaccurate, causing the teachers continuously delivering inaccurate knowledge to the kids, which finally leads to misconceptions. Moreover, according to the professor, those actions are instructed by power behind the scene, which means those are schemes that we are talking about for small groups’ benefits.

It’s such a shame that people are actually using education to destroy the civilization instead of teaching everyone about the status quo. Especially those companies which make tons of money out of the society, should be more cautious about maintaining the sustainable development for the human civilization instead of only the companies.

WSDAGW is both deceptive and compelling. It reeks of propaganda throughout the first couple of chapters. After having read the chapters, I realized that the book pretty much denies fact without significant rebuttal or alternative theories. The fossil fuel funders prove the book to have fishy motives, but the prose reads as if the authors are taking a genuine fallibilist stance rather than acting on behalf pure evil. The climate change dilemma needs to produce general consensus if we are to embark with an attitude of scientific realism. The book was sort of appealing because it took an underdog stance in a debate while appealing to the concept of free speech, and that the verdict on climate change shouldn't be so urgent if the evidence isn't compelling - a sort of theoretical 'innocent until proven guilty'.

This week's reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” was a terrifying example that many people see climate change as little to no threat. From the many sources we have seen just since the beginning of this class, we know this is inherently false. Shockingly and unfortunately the misinformation being spread by the publishing company and author has an impact on many. While there is an impact I find it surprising that anyone believes the material that was produced. Throughout the entirety of the reading there was zero scientific evidence to support their claims. I have never experienced scientists not using scientific evidence to support their hypothesis until now. 
        <br><br>

This is the 3% of scientists that don’t believe in the climate crisis. While the claims they make are terrifying we have 97% of scientists to trust. Hopefully with the help of the majority we can begin to make changes that will help our planet.

After reading the assigned chapters and the amazon reviews, I was very upset that fossil fuel companies are making this much of an effort to increase the doubt surrounding the climate crisis. I can not believe they would go as far as to send their books for free to K-12 teachers especially since, in previous lectures, we talked about how the younger generations will have to take initiative. It will not help if students are being misinformed about the climate crisis which will only cause even more skepticism. It is ridiculous that fossil fuel companies fund the Heartland Institution to help discredit scientists and their studies instead of helping spread awareness. “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” reminds me of the film “Merchants of Doubt” because the tobacco industry tried to hide the dangerous health issues that come with their product. In the same way, this book is trying to suppress the truth about global warming so that fossil fuel companies can continue to thrive.

I think that it's so scary how these fossil fuel companies are that powerful that they can distribute inaccurate information to such a large amount of people. The power that they have to control the media and the people is simply astonishing, and that's something that we should be extremely scared of. I too was shocked when they tried pushing their agenda onto K-12 students through free books. That is simply unethical and they KNOW that these students can be easily influenced. I'm ashamed of the lengths that they'll go to and that is one of the reasons why I'm so glad that higher education is giving us the chance to learn about the actual truth.

After watching this video describing Ken's interpretation of the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," I feel extremely concerned for the younger population that may be exposed to this information in pre-teen or even teenage years. The fact that a group is passionate enough to fight against what 97% of the population believes to be true is similar, for me at least, to propaganda and brainwashing techniques that have been exemplified throughout the course of history. It is scary to think that such a conservative group exists, however, I feel that because "we" (climate change believers) are the greater population, debunking these myths and disproving these statements will be easier. The most surprising part of reading this book was that its so well articulated and written that it actually does not seem like it is written by a conservative group hoping to manipulate the audience, rather it seems as if a bunch of scientists are gathering realistic and comprehensive evidence to support their claims.

<p>
The main thing that I took away from this video was kens statement about books claiming that anthropogenic climate change not being true was the fact that they are funded by big corporations that suffer from accusations of being assailants. This impacts me the most because the same thing goes through my head about big Corp. funded medicines and foods. Are we being fed fact facts on the basis of money? What is truly real in today’s society? This wouldn’t be the first time that I have heard that the population is being lied to in order to make money or to be manipulated and this truly scares me.

After reading the first chapters of the book" Why scientists disagree about global warming", I feel really confused and suspicious about the credibility of the statistics and figures used in this book, as well as the seemingly ridiculous demonstration. Just as ken said in his video that, it enables many people to question the trustability whether anthropogenic climate change is  really happening around us. Moreover, according to the background information provided by Ken's video, in which he mentions that these sort of claims are seemingly to be supported by the large corporations or financial groups. For instance, if a book denies the potential effects brought by the combustion of fuels, this book is very likely to be published with the sponsor of a fuel company.
        <br><br>
Another thing that really shocks me in his video that "as many as 30% of K-12 teachers teaching climate change tech that it is a two-sided argument." In my opinion, should the climate change skepticism be inculcated into the children's mind ,who are extremely sensible and easily to be swayed, how would they react and think about the ongoing changes that physically happen around them. In other words, would they repeat the wrongs or the neglects made by the previous generation? Would they consider the outcomes of their behaviors, and those impacts for the whole planet on which they live? I just cannot imagine the results.So, I feel really amazed and sad to hear about that the teachers are to some degree pushed( owing to the policies) to teach such disinformation to the kids, even if they know the truth.

After reading the article " Why scientists disagree about global warming", I started to feel disappointed and wordless. I am not surprised, but I do not know what say or what I can do. After watching the. documentary" A climate doubt", I knew more about the reality behind the scene of why the problem of climate change is well known but remained unsolved. There are always something that we normal people can not change, but I haven't thought it will be that extreme. Famous companies such as some  oil company can not let the policy come out to detriment their profits, so they even hire scientists to disturb people's sight about the truth of undeniable anthropological factor of causing climate change. I do not know why, and I do not want to learn about the reasons they are talking about in their article. I just hope the world could be less decisiveness and better. People do everything, or at least things will have effects on others, for the same goal.

After reading the document, I can see why so many people would believe that climate change isn’t occurring. Information is clearly presented in a way where the truth can be misconstrued, you start to almost believe it. It’s extremely unethical what the Heartland Institute is doing preying on vulnerable children and integrating skepticism into their minds at such an early age. This type of misinformation is dangerous because it removes the focus from the actual issue, we should be looking for solutions not trying to reverse the damage caused by people working for fossil fuel interests. A possible 10 million children may have come into contact with this harmful information which just creates the new generation of climate change deniers and skeptics.

Reading the first three chapters of Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming  frustrated me to such a degree that I had to take multiple breaks in between. I just am unable to fathom how a corporation can be so despicable and malignant in their ways. If I were an individual who had no knowledge on the subject of anthropogenic climate change, getting my hands on a book like this would be terrifying. The title itself already does its job in attracting the attention of the viewer. Furthermore, the way that the information is presented and structured while being supplemented with rhetoric allows this book to be extremely convincing. It’s even worse when I found out that copies of this propagandist piece were delivered to K-12 teachers for free. Teachers, who teach children, the pioneers of the future, were specifically targeted to further corrupt our youth and feed them lies. This all sounds like it’s from a horror movie, or better yet, a nightmare. Unfortunately, it isn’t. This is our reality. If Heartland Institute had spent as much effort spreading the truth about climate change as they did with trying to deceive the public, we would perhaps be at a different stage right now. Despite 97% of scientists agreeing that climate change is real and happening, corporations and families like the Koch brothers choose to prioritize the 3% that appeal to their needs and agenda. Why must the companies funding these types of propaganda be so driven by greed and selfishness? There is no regard for the future of humanity and for our only habitable planet by these conglomerates. Reading this just further accentuates my belief that education in these regards is highly important. We must do everything in our power to educate the public when it comes to fighting anthropogenic climate change.

Reading through “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming,” I felt angry. The fact that this book was made so widely available and distributed to influential people such as educators, politicians, policymakers, elected officials, etc. causes enough concern on its own, but thinking beyond that, it is alarming to consider how the information is transferred from these influential people to more vulnerable population groups like children. It truly reveals the extent that these climate change deniers are willing to go to confuse people into a stagnant so action is further delayed. Another thing I found bothersome is that their arguments are appealing if you aren’t aware of the reality of the climate crisis, which most of their targeted audience is not. For me, the background I have on the issue allowed me to see that each one of their arguments could be turned right back around on them. All of the claims they make about the climate change “movement” are almost laughable because the contrary actually applies to them. Yet it is slightly embarrassing and worrisome to think that people can be swayed by their extensive misinformation.

It's sad that climate change information is so unclear to the vast majority of people. This shouldn't be something that's viewed as an argument with more than one side. This is science. Data should be collected, and people should be presented with it. It's not right for people to try to twist things and use persuasion to push children into uncertainty.

When reading this week's chapters and watching Ken's video, it caused a sense of panic and uneasiness within my thoughts. Reading about how there was such a strong push and support for non-climate change believers left me a little in disbelief, how could they deny such a thing? As the chapters went on, and it described that there was false and incorrect use of articles and files to help support a positive climate change claim, alongside unbacked claims by those who claimed climate change to be real, it was unsettling but understandable for why others might not believe in it. It made sense as to why it caused disagreement within the science community. The community of teachers that received the free books for the school's education and that held a bunch of unfactual information really causes disbelief. These are children who will become the future of America, learning new information and understanding the way life works, and from young, they will believe in false and incorrect information in regards to climate change.

The fact that the book, "Why Scientist Disagree About Global Warming " was given out for free to not just anyone but specific people is alarming enough. They obviously wrote and sent these books to people for a purpose, which is to convince them that climate change is not what scientists say it is. They try spinning the facts and it all comes from personal gain. The people who wrote this book and the people who are running these anti climate change campaigns are backed by fossil fuel companies like the Coke Brothers. They only care about getting money even if that means lying to the public. They want the public to believe that climate change is not being caused by humans but that it is natural for the Earth to heat and cool. Which is true because there are patterns of cooling, but they are not looking at the whole picture because each decade gets hotter and hotter. They purposefully leave out other information that does not serve their agenda. They don't want people to think that it is human caused because that would mean that we would have to take action, and get rid of the fossil fuel industry. Which is why they sent it out to K-12 teachers. They want them to teach the next generation that scientists, can't be trusted because they would be able to continue the cycle of capitalism, giving them more wealth. They don't want people to realize that they're the problem and of course it's easier for people to just deny that climate change is being caused by humans and not have to take accountability.

I do not favor the wide extent in which companies and organizations largely endorse fossil fuels and its usage. Some efforts in their advocacy and message announcements appear to breach ethical boundaries between them and potential consumers. The concept of proceeding to provide digestable anti-climate change texts to the younger generation for personal growth and monetary gain continues to disturb me. In this sense, however, it goes to show how many perspectives there are to the issue of climate change. The confusion of what to advocate for worsens as appealing statistics and findings accumulate and are presented, despite their questionable credibility and gravitation toward a bias. Essentially, if one knows how to use their words carefully and with such conviction, anything can sound desirable and reasonable. Manipulation of this kind is not one to be played. Time is of the essence. There needs to be a breeze of clarity to demystify, before everything goes ablaze.

After reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", the information was startling, but it didn't change my mind about the current climate crisis and truly how desperate it is. Of course, I knew that the fossil fuel industry was lobbying to essentially cover up the damage they have done to the climate in exacerbating the climate crisis, but it was disturbing to read that they even went as far as to endorse research only supporting their claims, and then spreading false information to thousands or millions of people. It did make me question whether the information I have come across and believe about climate change is biased, but there's still overwhelming evidence that climate change is a real and serious problem. 
        <br><br>


And what's even worse to me is to hear that false research and propaganda was circulated to children in K- 12 schools, and that state laws allow and even condone that behavior. Those children are going to be our future, and to indoctrinate them with false information about climate change is almost unethical. Purposefully brainwashing children and young adults that anthropogenic climate change isn't real, or any form of that message robs the world of leaders and activists that would help make a change.

Before reading Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, I was warned that it could be very persuasive, so I was intrigued. The book was very well-written and if I didn’t know better, I could see myself believing the distorted information. The phrase “doubt is our product” came to mind because people just need to be confused to begin second guessing scientific evidence. After every section were the references, but like Ken informed us in lecture, when analyzing the sources we can see that either the sources are completely unreliable or misinterpreted data. I was a little impressed, but not shocked, by how informative and “scientific” the book was presented to be. We’ve already seen how the tobacco industry convinced people smoking was not harmful, so this book was no surprise to me. What was definitely a low blow was sending out free, unsolicited copies of the book to k-12 in the United States. It’s sick to think that they knew children would be easy targets. It further proves the fossil fuel industry and anyone affiliated with them is a twisted being who only looks after their own profit and self-interest.

While the reading was convincing, it did not confuse me or cause me to reconsider what I know to be true about the climate crisis, it only upset me. I am upset that a group of people can have so much power over what the public believes to be true. I think the fact that a campaign like this was successful reveals some of our societal issues, one being that money and power are directly proportional. For some reason, the more money a group or an individual has, the more American people are influenced by that group or individual, which leads to our unhealthy adoration of celebrities that have done nothing with their lives, but were simply born into money. I'm not saying that we shouldn't listen to anything people with money say, I just believe that we need to start thinking for ourselves. I think that is another societal issue, that people believe anything they read or hear, as long as there is a somewhat logical claim. People don't seem to be able to filter out what isn't likely to be true when they are presented with an argument, and are quick to doubt what they know to be true the instant they hear or see something that contradicts it. If we want to limit the amount of doubters in our society, we need to teach and encourage people to start thinking for themselves.

I had not read this book before you went over it in class on friday, and I have to say I would not have caught on to the Heartland Institute thing if we had not gone over it. Those wrote this book put a lot of care into making their logic seem legitmate. It is concerning to think about how this information can be twisted to trick or confuse people. But it really make sme question what on earth their motivations are? Surely people this smart know that the climate crissi IS real. What do they get out of denying it or convincing others to deny it? Even oil and coal lobbyists have to realize that they are killing themselves for money. These authors know that the Heartland Institute research is unfounded and know through theyre research for this work that climate change is a real issue. So what do they get out of denying it? The illusion of safety? These are intelligent people, I can’t understand why they’d rather bury their heads in the stand rather than fix something when they have an opprtunity to. 
         <br><br>
I found this work incredibly interesting and read to thenend, and I’d like to comment on the chapter on policy implications. The very first argument encountered in the chapter is the complaint that governments rely too much on the findings and beliefs of the IPCC, a biased group. This is a stupid argument for three reasons. 1) That’s blatantly incorrect, governments all over the world have their own research programs that support their policy beyond just the IPCC. Additionally, the IPCC works with findings done by other labs. So, not only getting their information from one source.  2) If you’re building a space program, you’re going to ask NASA, not the American Geosciences Institues. If you’re writing a paper, you want studies done by Harvard, not by Saint Regis (or Trump uniiversity for that matter). Why on earth would you NOT listen to the advice of the most qualified party. The IPCC is the may seem lke the most refrenced group FOR A REASON. It’s one of the best and most trusted groups! 
        <br><br>
3) LOOK AT YOUR OWN BIBLIOGRAPHY GOOD LORD. 
        <br><br>
 One thing in this entire book that i am certain is true is their statement “Climate change… global phenomenon with very different effects on different parts of the world.” Completely correct. If they are arguing that we should be looking to other countries instead of just the opinions of one, yeah good idea. Sure wish there was already a program working on studying the effects of climate change as it will affect people all over the world. Which is why we use the IPCC. You know, the INTERGOVERNMENTAL Panel on Climate Change run by the UNITED NATIONS. Also may I point out that an organization acknowledging the existence of a book and translating it does not imply the promotion of it? Example: (and I really hate to bring this book up because it distracts from the conversation and it’s always a cheap shot but it’s the best example I have) Mein Kampf. Publishing ≠ agreement. 
        <br><br>
 “the truth is we simply don’t know if climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed… The human impact on climate is small relative to natural variability, perhaps too small to be measured.” OKay. Sure. Maybe we aren’t CAUSING it. But we know it exists?? That the climate is unstable and variable and May possibly decide to kill all of use. And that we have the modern technology that means we can actually CONTROL these variables. Which is a) freaking whack that we are able to “control” the universe like that what the heck and b) SUCH A GOOD ARGUMENT ON WHY TO MAKE CHANGES. We have the ability to prevent catastrophes! We know things are changing, who knows wshy (we do but go off I guess). So do something!

One of the most striking aspects of the book was the projection. It is made  point in the introduction that the book gives hard science to support climate change skepticism. This is followed by many attempts to undermine the credibility of climate scientists and the accuracy of their numerous reports. The IPCC is even framed as a special interest group. They claim that the IPCC report is completely agenda driven and made with the intent of getting wind and solar companies more profit. All of this is decidedly not hard science, it is projecting what the NIPCC and Heartland Institute actually are. 
        <br><br>

It is very tragic that the target audience of this book was mainly, policy makers, teacher, and children. In a time of climate crisis there are very wealthy and powerful people who are denying science to protect profits, even with more money they could ever use. They are attacking the future through influential groups in society. This is extremely damaging as the climate has already begun to change. If children are deceived to believe that climate change is not severe the battle to stop it grows much tougher. We needed to act years ago, we need to act now, we will truly be forced to in the future.

While reading chapters 1-3 of the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I knew I had to remain open minded in order to try to understand why this perspective is spread. However, I found this extremely hard to do because the article immediately tries to discredit other scientists who do in fact believe in climate change. The introduction starts off by immediately debunking the claim that “97 percent of scientists” who believe that climate change is both a man-made and dangerous issue, is not true. The whole point of this book is to encourage climate change skepticism by trying to make the public believe research findings are overstated or exaggerated. This book immediately tries to debunk everything that goes against their beliefs, choosing to ignore and acknowledge the facts and research conducted by well-informed agencies that specialize in topics in regards to this issue. Personally, I did not find this text to be convincing enough, but it is important to note that this might not be the case for everyone. The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” presents lots of misleading information that can easily sway a reader into believing what they are reading is true if they do not understand the topic of climate change. This propaganda is dangerous and inaccurate,  and if presented to kids in school, it could shape the youth into believing climate change is a “hoax”. It’s unfortunate that this kind of material is able to be published and spread because it has the power to harm our planet and future even more. The authors of the books would not have to deal with the consequences, but other generations would be left to deal with them. Trying to profit by teaching children about climate change skepticism shouldn’t be part of anyone’s agenda.

Although my belief in climate change is still strong after reading the first three chapters of “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming,” I can see how one who is not well educated on global warming and the effects of increases in CO2 in our atmosphere could be persuaded by this book. The presentation of “factual” information rather than highly opinionated statements gives the illusion of credibility.
        <br><br>

Something that caught my eye in the arguments was the lack of consistency. One argument that was presented under the section titled “flawed surveys” questioned the credibility and academic achievement of scientists who were surveyed by Doran and Zimmerman, and used that as a way to discount the information that was found in their study. Under the section in chapter 1 titled “evidence of lack of consensus,” refutations for the consensus argument are presented by summarizing reports done by several different authors whose professions include doctors of medicine and scientists. What surprised me upon arriving at this section in the chapter was that the synopsis of the surveys conducted by  Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch did not include any information about who the scientists that they conducted the surveys on were, or whether or not they had the academic backgrounds to be answering questions regarding climate change. It all seemed very hypocritical to me due to the fact that they were questioning the validity of the people interviewed in the studies supporting the IPCC consensus, yet in the studies supporting their arguments they merely stated that they interviewed “scientists” without giving any information to validate the credibility of said scientists.
        <br><br>

I also found it interesting that in chapter two the authors make the statement that climate is an interdisciplinary subject and that not many have mastered more than one or two of the disciplines that make up climate change. I’m pretty sure scientists working together on projects is a thing...
        <br><br>

Overall I’m still scared as heck about climate change and fully believe that we need to reduce our emissions. Good try though, book

“Bony has also identifies uncertainty in climate science in the journal science,” “fundamental puzzles of climate science remain unsolved because of our limited understanding of how clouds, circulation,and climate interact,” “Essential physical aspects of climate change are poorly understood.” These words are written in Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming. It baffles me that the climate crisis can be undermined due to claims of uncertainty surrounding the science behind climate change. The evidence used in this piece appears to be cherry picked, bits and pieces failing to acknowledge the detriments that plagues the environment. Despite data and research that proves otherwise, the author continues to dismantle the predictions and words of accredited science due to the complex nature of science as a whole. This is also without regards to the visible damage around the globe.
        <br><br>
The piece also tackles bias, explain how climate scientists may encompass biases based on disagreement with other scientific work, grant-seeking purposes, or due to political views. The end result of this is corruption. I don't quite understand what an individual will gain by pushing for a more clean and green environment. I understand the troubles that my accompany almarism, but I feel that worst-case scenarios should be revealed to the public in order to give rise to action. Even if we do not live through or experience these scenarios, there will be individuals who will in fact have to if we do not implement new methods and techniques that will lessen the severity of an ongoing crisis. In addressing the potential hazards that face the planet, I believe that scientists and researchers should be open and clear about the details concerning the “when” and “why” of the potential consequences. It isn’t the time to sugar coat our role in climate change and polluting the world nor to undermine the steps needed to help the planet and environment.

After reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," I was very surprised that there are still so many people in the world who don't believe climate change is real. This problem is affecting every people's lives everyday. But there are still so many individuals out there in society who deny the existence of climate change. The book could fool almost anyone who had no background and knowledge about climate change. It is very well structured and written in a professional manner that can convince anyone that it seemingly has valid points. However, the readers should be aware that this book is supported by the people involved in the fossil fuel producing industry. It is extremely biased and continues to lead the public with false information that will not only prevent the public from being aware about global warming, but also will make the current situation a lot worse. And the part that infuriates me the most is that actual scientists are denying the existence of global warming. Although they have the potential and intelligence to prove the validity of global warming, they are continuing to mislead the audience with false concepts and etc. I hope the future generations can come together even more to solve this issue together.

I agree, the structure of the book is very simple and clear-cut that on the surface, the authors' points may seem logical. We have the advantage of reading the book knowing that the book's arguments are inconsistent and contain cherry-picked, unreliable evidence. I definitely believe that if my conservative parents, who don't know much about climate change, were given this book, they would be fooled. Since it's a real, offically printed book, it must contain truth, right? The spread of false information is so dangerous because it's so believable to many people, and we are so lucky to be in this class to learn how to dissect these arguments. Luckily, climate change is getting addressed more and more these days and we should be able to gather enough support to make some real changes soon.

At this point I’m no longer surprised to see the methods people use to deny climate change, having come across these types of arguments many times in my life. After taking English 22 last year, I tried to have a conversation with a family member about why he doesn’t believe in climate change. I presented an argument that I’d heard many times before: If your child was sick and 97 doctors that you took them to said to treat them one way, while only 3 said to treat them another way, who would you listen to? A pretty straightforward answer in my opinion. His response? “Well what’s the motivation of the 97? Where’s their paycheck coming from; who’s paying them to say that?” Hearing that was honestly astounding; I just don’t understand how someone can stand so resolutely in opposition to proven facts, because it just comes off as being purposely obstinate and contrary.
        <br><br>

The fact that this book was sent out to teachers and to schools is honestly appalling. Spreading this kind of misinformation in a deliberate attempt to confuse the public is beyond immoral. The idea of this book being taught in schools is truly saddening, because I know from experience how hard it is to try to unlearn things you were taught as a kid. When you’re young, it can be hard to disbelieve things that your parents or teachers tell you because you think: why would they lie? But it takes a while to understand that they themselves could be misinformed.

It is almost concerning how seemingly well-documented and prestigious the book portrays itself. I was totally under the impression that the statistics that were being stated were completely factual. While I do believe that the topics still have some merit (it is always good to have some skepticism), there are definitely many concerns that have arose over time. It is quite ironic that one of their main arguments was that many of the climate change findings are skewed due to political influence. While this fact is partially true, the same exact argument applies to both sides. The authors definitely had an agenda when writing the book despite them trying to seem as a neutral third party. 
        <br><br>
As I proceeded with the reading, I also began to notice the various straw man arguments that were being utilized. Towards the end of the third chapter, they state " the principle: “Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation” (United Nations, 1992, Principle 15). According to them, "This is a sociological precept rather than a scientific one and lacks the intellectual rigor necessary for use in policy formulation (Goklany, 2001)." Their justification for the principle being incorrect is that it is a sociological precept, and therefore, invalid? Sociology is a study literally designed to evaluate human problems. To say that the field "lacks intellectual vigor", and therefore, should have no influence, is almost insulting.

It is horrible that misinformation can be spread this way. There can be no positive benefit to spreading these lies except for making fossil fuel industry pockets fatter. This is pure propaganda and is vile with it's misleading lies and who knows how far this has set back the consciousness of how many people back. It is very clear that 97% of scientists agree on climate change but “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” tries to flat out deny that facts and that the fact that climate change is even happening. This further cements my belief that the biggest obstacle for the climate crisis is the divide in politics and giant corporations being able to buy politicians. This was definitely a frustrating read and I am disappointed that something like this is able to exist.

While reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" I was stunned and disappointed as they tried to dismiss climate change as a political tirade that lacks scientific backing. Denying anthropogenic climate change isn't just stupid it's dangerous, lives are already being affected with families losing their loved ones or their belongings due to various natural disasters. Getting this book out there is simply a form of propaganda that was meant to shape young minds and those of influence in order to take away from the issue at hand. The reasoning as to why they would do this is so that the fossil fuel industry won't lose support as it's a powerful industry with lots of money and money can make people do some pretty terrible things. But simply lying and completely denying the facts won't do any good because the damage will only continue to worsen and each new generation will deal with the consequences and even the existing ones now. It's just overall truly disheartening and displays how humanity at times prey on their own downfall by not being there or truly caring.

I sympathize with the states and policy makers that wish to restrict K-12 teachers from preaching their political views to children. I often found my High School teachers trying to "indoctrinate" students into their line of thought, and would actively favor those who bought into their agenda. However, restricting teachers from spreading information from viable, peer-reviewed sources is despicable. The fact that companies whose profits rely on the exploitation of the Earth hold so much power that they can affect the education system is frightening. I also find it frightening that companies are actively sponsoring anti-climate change articles and research, so much so that books like "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" come off as genuine and trustworthy.
        <br><br>

I found the stance taken by the authors of "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" to be strangely solid. Instead of resorting to name calling and demonization, I found a book that wanted to be taken serious. That is, until the authors began to negate the quality of the arguments by climate change supporters based on the idea that their focus in a specific field nullifies their ability to see the entire picture, and are thus confirming their own biases. While I can see some truth to their statement, I found their opinion on an economist's point of view on climate change to be humorous. The author's state that economist's overestimate the benefits of living in a cleaner, more eco-friendly place, and that supplying clean air and water to the masses is overrated. While I may have paraphrased a bit, it was at this point in the book that I could no longer believe anything it had to say.

After viewing the text provided by the Heartland Institute it was beyond feasible to imagine how anyone may come to believe it’s contents. Firstly, before I watched any videos or read any text, I noticed how much of the Heartland Institute is targeted information being launched at anyone who will engage. Their website is a .org. Correct me if i’m wrong, but this web address is fairly arbitrary. .orgs can be easily accessible without much of a hassle or selectivity. The official literature of the Heartland Institute seems to me like it was mirroring (mostly trying to mirror) more reputable sources like academic texts or research organizations. The color scheme, layout, tone and level of credibility based on appearance was very similar.
        <br><br>

The fact of the matter is, the ability to differentiate the integrity of these two polar ideologies, is through education- specifically education about it. Climate change is massive, and widespread. But it also came on in the span of a life. Many people don’t feel the effects because they know nothing but the effects. It is non negotiable, but it also does not cause concern in every neighborhood in every continent. How can anyone who knows nothing about a topic, be expected to (at least at first) sift through information and deem what is true and what is false. Access to this information is valuable. The ability to understand the climate crisis is a blessing in and of itself. You cannot protect yourself from a danger you do not understand, especially one you do not know.

Reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” made me cringe at the inaccuracy and complete falseness of it all. These convincing and manipulative stories are so dangerous and should be considered a threat to global security. It made me feel that this sort of misinformation should be illegal, as it directly could harm millions in the long run. This procrastination in the government due to these types of books and “scientific evidence” is creating a movement against climate change and it is absolutely disgusting. It reminded me of the anti-vax movement where a false article was put out in saying that vaccines cause autism. However, that is clearly not the case with new scientific evidence that shows no correlation between vaccinations and autism. However, this “study” had a long lasting impact and created an entire anti-vax movement, that had people, including my own mother, questioning if vaccines actually did cause autism. This is especially dangerous for people who cannot get vaccinations so they rely on herd immunity. However, they have a higher chance of getting infected if less people are vaccinated. What made me the most angry was in the reading where it said “A warming of 2°C or more during the twenty-first century would probably not be harmful, on balance, because many areas of the world would benefit from or adjust to climate change.” This disgusted me because of the ignorance and pure stupidity of this statement. There is not a single area that has benefited from climate change and the fact that they claim people will “adjust” to climate change is, in a way,  offensive. You can’t “adjust” to fires and hurricanes. What disgusted me even more was the reviews on Amazon supporting the book. This misinformation could be dangerous.

"Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” truly helps me aware of how skeptics could possibly break up the established scientific evidence and consensus. Although there is 97% of scientists agreeing with the fact that climate change is anthropogenic and happening right now, this book is still trying to deny it and consider it as a hypothesis without evidence supported. It really got me worried that if skeptics like this keep misleading the public with their absurd statements, the situation would be worse and worse. As Ken mentioned in the video, the Heartland Institute is one of the false knowledge sources that provide inaccurate information for students like us. Based on this, I totally agree with Ken that education is the key to solve our climate crisis.

After reading chapters 1-3 of Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, I was concerned to see how the writers tried to convince the reader to feel towards climate change. Aside from the illogical claims made in the book, what disturbs me the most about this book is that it was unsolicitedly distributed to 300,00 school teachers, in order for them to educate their students on the books claims. This is concerning because those young students who have learned anything from this book will be “in charge” one day, and they will be skeptics to the issue. This means that there will be more deniers and the climate crisis would only become a larger problem than it already is. It also means that there would be less people taking actions to prevent/resolve the climate crisis because it would not exist to them. When I was in K-12, I definitely trusted what my teachers taught me, and certain things that I was taught still stuck with me. K-12 educators have an immense impact on their students, so for them to teach young students to be climate change skeptics, especially according to this book, is horrifying.

When I first began reading “Why Scientists Disagree with Global Warming”, I was admittedly impressed with their ability to almost make me question something I felt so sure about, however as I read more closely it became plainly clear their claims were unsubstantiated . Generally speaking I think this book has the potential to convince an unsuspecting reader through distraction, misconstrued facts, and bogus sources. Moreover any use of fact or statistic was cherrypicked out of context and reworded in a way to compliment their argument. Not only do I find it disheartening that this information was disseminated to convince the public the climate crisis does not exist but also ashamed to know this group targeted K-12 teachers. The language used in the book was strategic especially when in reference to those who believed in climate change, referred to in the book as alarmists and characterizing believers as radicals. 
         <br><br>
This book just as countless broadcasts and media outlets has politicized this issue and further uses this book as an agenda. Frankly, it is the spread of counteractive information like this that needs to be addressed through making people properly informed and knowledgeable on the climate issue. Climate change as a topic of conversation has just recently gained attention but with the growing resistance stemming from groups like these, more needs to be done on the side of educating the public.

I completely relate to your experience of being convinced at first by the arguments in “Why Scientists Disagree with Global Warming.” I began reading the book much as the average reader would, taking the text at face value and somewhat trusting the authors’ knowledge, and just as Ken warned, I began to wonder if their claims were legitimate. However, because the goal of this book is to convince those with no former knowledge of the issue and to fuel the fire of those who are already climate change deniers, the writers knew that the “research” and “credible sources” involved only had to be a facade. This is why, when put under any level of scrutiny, one can see the contradiction in this book’s own arguments, the illusion of evidence that doesn’t exist, and the incorrect interpretations of legitimate data.
         <br><br>

 I found the book’s criticisms of the IPCC especially laughable. Pages and pages are dedicated to arguing that the IPCC is biased and funded by political interests, when the book’s own publisher, The Heartland Institute, is itself funded by political interests with a clear agenda aligning with fossil fuel interests and against climate change action. Those involved in the creation of this book were masterful at crafting arguments to fool the public, and apparently saw their target audience as too dumb to possibly see the hypocrisy in their own text.

As soon as I read the first paragraph, I scoffed because of the bold claim that the reading made that the claim that the climate crisis is man made and 97% of scientists agree is false. The article immediately proceeds to call the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) alarmists and the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change(NIPCC) skeptical. Even after acknowledging that well-known agencies such as NASA has put this statistic on their websites, they blatantly say that this is false. Honestly, to me this is a joke and the article is being ignorant of what is right in front of them. In many cases, the article calls out the claim to be of scientists who are unqualified, but it could be possible that the same could be said for the author of the article. The only thing this reading contributed to my notion towards the climate crisis is that the other side begins to sound a bit more unbelievable.
         <br><br>

When I watched Ken’s video, I began to grow a little angry because of the fact that children were targeted so that they would see climate change as nothing big when in fact it is a huge problem. The number 10 million astounded as that could be 10 million children who are unaware of the fact that the earth is slowly dying and that drastic measures may need to be taken in order to save the earth. The problem that we face right now as a society is that we don’t want to acknowledge that there is a global problem going on right now and we are spending time trying to convince people that there isn’t. We have to gather up as a whole and begin to look at the problem together in order to do something or else we will lose our earth in ignorance.

If I'm going to be completely honest this reading did make me a bit skeptical at times. Was I ever fully swayed by the climate deniers? No. But they did a good job of at least creating a bit of reasonable doubt in my mind. By showing how the evidence towards the agreeing consensus was misinterpreted in chapter one and by claiming that most scientists are not experts in enough disciplines to be able to make these claims, the Heart Land Institute makes a very solid argument against the climate crisis. Because of this I think that articles like this are very dangerous. If these articles are read by those who do not have a full understanding of both sides of the debate then they can be very convincing. 
         <br><br>

The Heart Land Institute does a very good job at targeting the evidence that is used to support the idea of a climate change consensus. By providing fairly solid evidence that disproves the idea of the consensus and attacking the IPCC, they are able to make the scientific facts very confusing, which can leave one stuck in between both sides of the debate. It is important to realize that at the end of the day the majority of scientists conclude that climate change is indeed anthropologic and the evidence is there. The idea that I want to end my comment with is that is very important to take into consideration that these articles are also funded by those who would be at loss if action against climate change took place (fossil fuel companies).

I do find it interesting and almost upsetting that teachers aren’t as educated on Climate Change as they genuinely should be. As mentioned, children are the biggest targets for this message to get across, and teachers are the avenue needed for the further push of this message. Without reaching the younger generations, this idea of Climate Change and the steps needed to take to fix it, simply won’t happen nor be carried on. I also find it very interesting that educational books have been produced by conservative think tanks that are in reality funded by fossil fuel sources in which further stray ideas away from fixing climate change. The fact that fossil fuel companies are the funder’s of the children’s education shows they also want to pinpoint the youth in being supporters of their business blindly. I’ve heard many instances and relatively similar thoughts about different political parties and the college system, and generally believe there are various forms of indoctrination in the school system that the unsuspecting eye would never see on both sides of the coin. While now hearing both sides of this coin after reading this article, I still am skeptical about the complete truth and validity of both sides of the argument. I do see the realist and truthful side of the climate change argument, but still am skeptical to exactly how truthful each and every claim of this funding and way that conservative think tanks are doing so is true. I do love hearing both sides and being able to pick and choose exactly what deems to me as truthful or correct vs claims that are also very outlandish and almost baffling people can even consider true. In conclusion, I don’t see a reason why people or other scientist wouldn’t believe in the Climate Crisis, but do see why some claims and aspects of activism can make others skeptical and almost worried exactly of the state and future of our Earth.

The article "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is supposed to skew our minds from the thoughts of Climate Change, and steer into not believing it and the attempts to demonize the perspectives of so-called alarmists, in hopes of convincing us that Climate Change is simply a myth. Although the text presents some very clear and convincing points, my mind had been solidified with the idea that Climate Change is an ever-growing environmental epidemic that we must combat as soon as possible. The article, doesn't really prove the idea of how climate change isn't real and if it were how anthropogenic and human actions were the cause, but just attacks and attempts to disprove the IPCC and just bash on them; some parts were convincing, but not enough to change my mind. Most of these so called environmentalist or "scientists" are a true reflection of how a lot of the science is politically-driven making it difficult to believe what these labs and scientists feed us. 
         <br><br>
I also found it interesting how Mr. Hiltner said how education is a key aspect and role in the Development of solutions and success, because he's totally correct. If we are being misinformed, it truly shows the corruption In the science industry and how they utilize their credibility for their own selfish personal gain. We, as the future of this nation and this world, need all the help and resources we can get. This is a devastating issue that must be dealt with now.

For me, this has probably been the hardest reading assignment that we have received yet. For once, the difficulty of class readings did not come from the large jargon used in the piece or the incredible boring-ness and un-profound tone of the words, instead, I found myself more and more frustrated and confounded with each word I read. To think that someone was able to write this, to convince themselves the text was true, all the way to the point of thinking it needs to be available to everyone else because they need to read it so badly, it’s incredibly astounding. There is so much going wrong here that I can’t even decide the worst part. From the lack of sources with such bold statements to the misleading references at the end all the way to the books initial title, Why Scientists Disagree on Climate Change. This book was created to trick people who aren’t able to help themselves, and it is overall just a cruel text that is a large part of the fight to end the human race.

I tried reading the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” with an objective mind – I must admit that the authors do a solid job of trying to convince the reader that climate change is not caused by humans, but instead is the course of nature. Although it was interesting to read a book from this perspective, it is also very scary. Several copies of this book are sold and read every year, which means that several people are consuming information that could demotivate them from actually helping to prevent climate change. This, combined with the fact that K-12 teachers are not doing a good job of educating young children about the effects of climate change, is dangerous for the future. Preventing further climate change needs total participation, and having groups of people with either careless or opposing points of view will definitely be a limiter going forward. 
         <br><br>
One of the most convincing (but falsely stated) parts of this book is on page 16, where the author discusses for reasons behind the productivity of alarmists and skeptics. The author mentions reasons such as “publication bias” and “resume padding” as rationale for why there are so many climate scientists who believe in human caused climate change. This is simply wrong – the majority of scientists who believe in climate change are not doing so for their own good – they are doing so because there tangible, serious events across the world that are happening. Glaciers are melting, temperatures are rising at a rate which we have never seen, animals across the planet are dying. In order for us to actually slow down climate change moving forward, we must come to a full agreement on this debate.

To say the very least I was shocked that fossil fuel companies have been reaching out to teachers, it just feels like a very desperate, manipulative, and obvious ploy. After close consideration though, this does make sense because it is the easiest way they could reach children. This campaign has indeed been successful because I actually remember seeing this book at some point in my educational experience. It's sad to see how easily mass corporations can corrupt young minds, and I think this should be a very alarming signal to the general public about how we are all targets of such campaigns. None of the claims in the book present substantial evidence, it’s all just a scheme to enable their poor behaviors.It's shocking people can even still be divided on this issue, and truly I think people will be until its widely acknowledged that this is not a political issue.

All I'd like to comment is that "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" has one section where they say "bUt ThE cOnSeNSuS pApErs R WroNg" - and that that stuff is simply not true. The part where they cite "only 75% of papers on global climate change say it's an issue" is because the other 25% don't take the time to write out what they view as a settled topic.

I was very surprised that a lot of the things said in these 3 chapters appeared very reasonable. The authors who wrote the book appear as under dogs by giving the impression that those who questioned the "lack of consensus" in the scientific community were victims to global movements with an inherent political agenda. What I noticed towards the end however was how the 3 chapters, and I assume the book as well, lack any real concrete content. The authors spend more time pointing out minor flaws in the process and painting this image of a scientific community and politicians jumping the gun on climate change but don't have any real argument to present. I think this is the inherent point of the book, to sow skepticism into the reader. I feel like we have an inherent bias towards things that will affect us negatively and that our mind intrinsically sways towards a sense of comfort, even if this comfort has no real basis. I believe that is what the book aims to do, show that some people disagree about climate change and that there is some hope that nothing disastrous will happen. That reassurance combined with the mind's tendency to want to believe in its security is enough to convince the reader to stay passive about climate change.

I first became familiar with "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" in a previous environmental studies class at UCSB. When reading it again, I tried to be open minded when considering the arguments presented. At first glance, the article can be convincing. The article presents what appears to be scientific reasoning to debunk the climate change crisis, and goes even further to point on the flaws in several publications that support climate change. However, the data presented by the article is not only false, but heavily skewed towards presenting an argument that seems convincing to an unsuspecting reader. I find it incredibly disheartening that the authors of this piece are knowingly making this widely available to politicians, business leaders, and children. By making it accessible online, anyone can view this article. Without an adequate background of information about climate change, a reader can easily be swayed to believe that the climate change problem is simply a liberal agenda. It is ironic that the publishers of this article sought to bring down climate change activists for their data, while simultaneously presenting false data of their own.

In my daily life, more and more people around me start to pay more attention to environmental issues like global warming. There are so many evidence to prove that the process of global warming is changing our planet and having negative influences on our society. The article offers me a very interesting and different perspective to see the reasons why some people deny the existence of global warming and believe it is necessary to put regulations or react to these problems. The article states that there is actually no consensus among the scientists toward the issue of global warming. Not every scientist, who do not believe human activities cause global warming, is from the fossil fuel industry. And a lot of famous and widely spread articles are not very reputable, like Oreskes’s essay about 75 percent scientists support human activities are responsible for global warming,but the essay is not peer-reviewed.
         <br><br>

The article shows me a lot of information that I have never heard about, and corrects many misunderstandings. Social media and the mainstream media are very powerful to influence many people and their perspectives toward certain issues. It is very important for people to remember to have the ability to double check the information and its credibility. To always have the characteristic of questioning and proving whether the information is correct, do not follow other people blindly.

It's interesting to note that the book criticizes climate change scientist's firm "settled" beliefs and their rejection of anyone who suggests otherwise, essentially they are villinised. Specifically the book says "But true science is never “settled,” and true scientists are always eager to  ask  and  answer  questions...". Awesome they think this way because by the same regards we should also question the idea that climate change is not real because findings change and our earth changes.
         <br><br>
Also the article brings in the question, ""Why bother?” Why impose regulations that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars a year, destroy millions of jobs, and condemn millions of people to lives of grinding poverty, if there is virtually no  beneficial  impact  on  Earth’s  climate? " Okay what? Yes it will cost money but so does everything else (having to fix up after natural disasters costs money as well and supported to cost even more). The reduction of jobs is not how it would go down, it would actually create more jobs to make the Eco friendly switch and in turn boosting the economy.I don't his will condemn people to poverty (I get what they might be trying to say; If we are talking about powering homes solar panels cost at around 10k and above so in many ways it's still expensive for families to go green on their own. )-if the government provides the resources for people this will make Eco friendly systems/products more accessible and break the idea that only wealthy people can truly be green. 
         <br><br>
Lastly, I really appreciate Ken's commentary on the targeting of teachers for this book; I did not realize how important it was for these fossil fuel corporations to confuse teachers because teachers either aware or unaware would pass down these beliefs or influence their students to view climate change as a topic up for debate. This instills doubt and enables children to downplay the severity of this crisis.

Its interesting how Prof. Ken talked about Bills in a few states that prevent teachers from teaching climate change because it would influence the way students would learn. Doesn't giving away free books such as "why scientist Disagree About Global  Warming" in itself, a way of influencing the way students learn? It's sort of a contradiction when you think about it. I wonder how people would treat studies done by scientist who are paid for or backed by fossil fuel corporations,  if there's somewhere on the page or website a huge "PAID FOR BY XX CORPORATION." I feel like this is why many people are unsure about climate change because scientist who sound reputable are influenced by 3rd party affiliates and might be abusing their credentials for their own agendas. There are so many contradictions going on in climate change that people don't know who or what to believe. Maybe one thing we can do is pass a bill to make obvious, who is backed by large fossil fuel companies and who isn't. I'm pretty sure most people would read "why scientist Disagree About Global  Warming" differently if it had a "WARNING PAID FOR BY FOSSIL FUEL CO."  label on its front page.

During my years in elementary school, I firmly remember "global warming" being taught by my teachers with absolute certainty. "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" made me realize that it's so easy to disinform even the ones who are supposed to rightfully prepare kids for the future. Even with this small amount of confusion, it creates more red tape in policy change. There's not enough time for us to be skeptical about science.

         <br><br>

I'm extremely worried about these attacks since it's the teacher that our kids look up to for the most part. I feel immune to the disinformation since I was taught from elementary that global warming was a growing problem, and I still, to this day, believe in the coming problems we will face if we will not act now.

I am a little surprised that I am being convinced a little bit…Soon I realized that is because the NIPCC report is switching between concepts to defend their points and deny climate changes. The method they use to protect their fallacy is, instead of presenting new data, fighting against the evidence that climate activists have pointed out. They are either using the fake data to lie or attacking what they called the methodology inside only some of the articles of climate activists. I would say it is quite incredible to have this ability to make such a big lie and deny the truth as evident as it is. I am just curious, don’t they feel hilarious for themselves (because I don’t believe they are not aware of the truth); have they ever felt a bit a shame or sorry for the future generation. And these questions are what we can use to convert their points of view.

In this article, "Why scientists disagree with global warming" is to discredit the results of scientific research on climate change over the years. This article took a lot of time and also lost the reputation of IPCC. Before reading this article, I always thought that I had a good education and understanding of climate change issues. I have been criticizing leaders and some educated scientists, politicians and environmentalists for opposing climate change as untrue.

I found that most of these articles and ideas were sponsored by the famous fossil fuel think tank. The company sent 300,000 copies of misinformation, which can affect 10 million children well, which is really shocking. Because of the lack of funding for many K-12 schools, and because the books were sent free of charge. Since children are always naive and naive, and have little sense of critical thinking, they are easily misled and deceived by them. In contrast, those companies are far more visionary than ours, and they have been misled from a child to keep making money in the future. And we did n’t work hard on the planet for the continued life of our children and grandchildren

Getting an insight on what the opposing side has to say regarding the climate crisis was interesting because you get to observe how both sides of the debut support their claims with substantial detailed arguments that could make a reader feel conflicted about what is real, and what isn't. Reading the first few chapters of "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I noticed how some of the references mentioned were from the readings, films, and discussions from Ken's class. Literally everything I've learned from this course so far was mentioned in a book that was written by a climate crisis denier. So initially, it's safe to say I felt mislead by the articles, Al Gore's  film, and other climate crisis centered article/video I believed in. I think Ken even mentioned multiple times the book is not meant would get into our heads a little. But I understand now that the reason why we should reflect on a book written by a denier is because it strongly exemplifies the corruption in our society. When a globally threatening issue is presented to us, why would it be of the people's interests to deny it with such strong dedication, rather than taking a moment to reflect on the fact that this is a widely detrimental situation? Considering one of the major points Ken mentioned in the video, websites, advertisements, campaigns, articles, research, etc. that are against climate change are likely funded by fossil fuel companies. The spread of misinformation which claim global warming as a false and poorly supported topic is a sneaky tactic that everybody needs to be aware of before they almost fall in the trap like myself. Clearly, their motive is to convince the majority into denying the climate crisis so that they won't discontinue their consumption of products provided by fossil fuel companies, otherwise they would lose power. This situation highlights the greed of big companies and how they don't care for the wellbeing of the environment nor the people in it because their interests are only focused on money and power.

To say the very least I was shocked that fossil fuel companies have been reaching out to teachers, it just feels like a very desperate, manipulative, and obvious ploy. After close consideration though, this does make sense because it is the easiest way they could reach children. This campaign has indeed been successful because I actually remember seeing this book at some point in my educational experience. It's sad to see how easily mass corporations can corrupt young minds, and I think this should be a very alarming signal to the general public about how we are all targets of such campaigns. None of the claims in the book present substantial evidence, its all just a scheme to enable their poor behaviors.It's shocking people can even still be divided on this issue, and truly I think people will be until its widely acknowledged that this is not a political issue.

The text “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, in all honesty was not at all captivating. It seemed that a lot of the arguments against anthropogenic global warming were trying to portray certain unrelated facts in a way to make it seem really riveting. For example the text talks about how not only do scientists disagree about what exact impacts global warming would come in the future but also which of these is the most important. I found these statements a bit idiotic because does it really matter what would be the most important detriment of different possible impacts? What is important is that there are possible deleterious impacts and we need to try our best to prevent those. What matters most is that at least scientists can agree that affects will definitely be catastrophically harmful. I also found it interesting that they have the time and money to invest in that many books to persuade newer and future generations but no tolerance for anthropogenic global warming theories. I think that distributing such biased books and infiltrating the education system is very dangerous because it's literally teaching young kids who will end up deciding the ultimate path for the future biased information that makes them prone to not acting.Education is an institution that we don't question and rarely stray from what we are told, when thousands of future policymakers and action takers are only given a one sided view of something as important as this, it truly shows how any institution can be structured and purposely infiltrated to push an agenda that will ultimately harm us. Even if some are not set on the man-made theory, we should still be taking our actions into consideration and try to limit our impact as much as possible considering what we can predict for a possible future.

It is easy to see why the book, Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, can come across as a very convincing source against the severity of the climate crisis. The text is well written /formatted and uses clear language (that still sounds educated and just scientific enough) that appeals to lay people, as opposed to the scientific jargon that many of the publications in support of climate change use. It is very clearly directed at persuading the general population rather than the scientific community on climate change.  The reason this book has the power to have such an impact is because it tells the reader what they subconsciously want to hear. You want to believe that the climate crisis isn’t real, and that climate change is due to natural rather than human causes, because facing the reality of the situation is scary and difficult. This book gives you the perfect out to keep living in blissful ignorance and continue living life the same way as usual because its argument is presented in a scientific manner, with “evidence” rather than just as propaganda.

         <br><br>


However, if you choose to look past the “easy way out” that this book offers, it is very clear how biased it is. The first paragraph of the foreword literally stets, “President Barack Obama and his followers have repeatedly declared that climate change is ‘the greatest threat facing mankind.’ This, while ISIS is beheading innocent people, displacing millions from their homeland, and engaging in global acts of mass murder.”, setting an undeniably biased tone against the climate crisis from the very beginning. It’s ironic that the authors talk about how scientists are biased due to external influences when this book is probably the most biased of all of the sources it references. It is also shocking that despite this explicit bias, this book was allowed to be distributed to schools and used within the education system. It is scary to see the lengths that the conservative think tanks Ken mentions in lectures will go to in order to keep their power and manipulate the public.

The document, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” does a good job of appearing as a “credible source” for the opposing argument of the climate crisis on the surface.  However, when it comes down to the details, the articles within the piece had little to no scientific evidence to refute the enormous amounts of research and data that 97% of all scientists believe in to deem climate change as a real and ever pressing issue for our present and future.  The writers spent quite a bit of time trying to discredit believers in the climate crisis with petty name-calling and many fallacies.  The sources cited, contradict themselves and the points of the article over and over again, and really made the oversight embarrassing to me.  To the unsuspecting eye, these texts may seem very well written and convincing for the work they’ve put into it, but the thing with science and statistics is that you can manipulate the data to tell any story you want.

First reading the book Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, I had been drawn into the rhetoric and language that the authors chose to use. I almost felt that I was being manipulated somehow, thinking that personal beliefs and ideas about the earth warming were false. 
         <br><br>
One point in the book that I thought was completely made up of common reasoning was the “Bias” section that scientists have in the discussion of climate change. I believe that the narrative of these scientists being “biased” due to their personal interests and funding is false. I believe that if such a phenomenon was occurring, it would be a much more talked about and widespread worry in the science world. I know personally that when going through experiments that all members need objectivity training, a long process that ensures that scientists are basing their information on facts and scientific evidence alone. The book also hints that peer review is almost always “no guarantee of the accuracy or value of a research paper.” I don't believe that the book had gone in depth with this topic and didn't really explain as to why peer reviewed scientific articles are always falsified.I believe that rejecting an article due to its fabrication and biases (for grant funding/personal interests) is much more common than letting it through to be published to the world.
         <br><br>
What this book lacks (from what I have read so far) is the ability to recognize the real earthly tragedies that have struck the earth due to climate warming. There is unbiased and observational evidence that states that the amount of wildfires, harsh weather patterns, hurricanes, and many more are increasing rapidly. What else would cause these events to be happening?



</p><hr>



<p>

As I read "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" I came to realize the power words carry. Even without any actual scientific evidence backing up their claims, many people would be convinced by this article due to the wording. It may come off as convincing information to those who are not educated on the topic, which unfortunately is a huge chunk of the world. As Ken mentioned,  many teachers, those who have the most influence on a nation's youth, do not have the correct information about climate change. Many are skeptical or believe it is not as urgent as some may think, this mindset is then transferred to the children they teach. 
         <br><br>
Fossil fueled corporations control many aspects of society, they bribe government officials and spread false information that they fabricate themselves. They keep people in a bubble; they create doubt as to what information is real and what is not, this is the main reason why people are unable to see the truth.  
         <br><br>
The world is always terrified of propaganda, but what they fail to realize is how much of it surrounds our daily life. A quote that Ken mentioned from the reading was, "we breathe it out, plants breathe it in, they call it pollution, we call it life." This single line terrifies me, that fact that they are correlating the main reason that can end our entire race, to life, is beyond me. To think the only motive behind their thoughts and actions is a piece of paper.


</p><hr>



<p>

Just like the film, if I did not have the knowledge I do about climate change, I would have been persuaded by the article. I thought it was interesting to read about their point of views and how their portrayed the “alarmists” versus the mere “skeptics”. The two thing that have truly been bothering me are 1) what is so wrong about caring for the environment and other generations and 2) the length companies are willing to go based off greed. I also found it a little frightening that we are able to say anything and most people just believe it without doing any research of their own.



</p><hr>



<p>

Maybe I am biased because of my strong belief in the climate crisis, but this book did not seem convincing at all too me. Sure, compared to the rest of the wack, basement-dweller type of climate change denial articles out there it may seem legitimate, but when your entire argument is based on attacking the opposing side's credibility you start to focus. Going back to middle school and the 3 basic rhetorical appeals, there was one fallacy every single one of my teachers warned about: attacking the author. The premise is that if you build your ethos only by attacking another's your argument falls apart as you lose focus of your intended argument (climate change denial) and end up in a senseless rant. This book did just that. The very first couple of paragraphs talk about how the government and scientists are in it for their own interests and throughout the first third of the book it is nearly impossible to go a few sentences without some reference to how scientists want to purposefully deceive the public.
         <br><br>


Another aspect that bothered me is the fact that these educators are not fact checking their sources. If all of these "legitimate-appearing" sources are all publicly known to be shadily funded by third parties that will directly profit from the proposed course of action, why are they still persuaded? If anything reading this book and seeing your consequent video, ended up disappointing me more in our educational system and our gullible, downright moronic half of our society than influencing my belief about the climate crisis. Most in not all social studies and English middle school teachers have to go over the topic of propaganda, and how it is directly responsible for bipartisanship and worse yet, the spread of evil ideals such as Nazism during the second world war. Are they really unable to recognize, that which they have essentially studied and are now more than likely teaching?



</p><hr>



<p>
I agree with Ken that education plays a big part in the awareness of the society of climate change. In my opinion, this is one of the biggest factors that can and will influence the future of our planet. Unfortunately for those who are aware of all the terrible consequences, the majority of the population prefers to believe/is made to believe in something that completely avoids science and all the facts that have been laid out for them. And such manipulations of people's consciousness and freedom of thought, both of which I think should be illegal, are being done by those who will be affected by this problem the least. To be honest, this whole situation looks like an apocalypse, and it is very surprising how so few people actually care about it and are willing to bring huge changes to their lives.

         <br><br>

It terrifies me how common misinformation is. But what is more surprising is how few teachers spread the correct information to their students. It is simply negligent from their side. It is very sad that they do not realize how much they are affecting the future. 

         <br><br>

On the other side, the people who were taught about climate change are now fully aware of it. This gives me hope that the newest generations can be well informed about this issue.

When I was reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I went in with the expectations that my beliefs would be challenged and that I would struggle with what I believed to be truth and what is fiction. While I certainly found it interesting to see the other side and its criticisms on the climate crisis movement, I was overall unconvinced by many of the arguments made within the text. While I am admittedly biased myself due to having grown up with the belief that climate change is real and occurring, I could not help but notice that the word choice of the author(s) were rather loaded and showing of their stance on the matter, such as labeling climate change activists “alarmists”, while people who denied the movement were merely “skeptics” and “critics”. The effect of this word choice is that it ends up creating a much more positive image for those against the climate crisis to the readers. This indicated to me that the people behind this publication were not necessarily interested in revealing the truth, but rather to push their own agenda, despite any statements to the contrary. It ends up reading like propaganda for the climate change denial movement to me.
         <br><br>

Furthermore, there were many claims made that were not supported with evidence, such as their claim that “few global warming skeptics have ever been paid by the fossil fuel industry.” (Idso et al., 50) There is a lack of evidence to support this claim, yet the author claims it is true to discredit the accusation that climate change deniers are financially supported by fossil fuel industries. There are other claims and blanket statements made throughout the text similar to this one, yet they are mostly stated to be true without being supported by evidence. While I will credit the text in that it is an overall fairly easy to understand text and well-laid out, it overall does little to persuade me in its merits.

<p>

Reading the book, I was quite astonished at how factual the ideas and facts are presented. Although I was warned beforehand by Ken, I saw myself slowly getting sucked into the propaganda. I had to remind myself that the book was meticulously created to seem official. Reading it infuriated me, knowing how the creators of the book deliberately distributed copies of it (over 300,000) to K-12 teachers, politicians, and anyone else who had a platform of power. The book was basically forced upon them, getting it sent to them without them wanting it. Those people were ultimately caught off guard with the book, which led them to getting persuaded. This persuasion would reflect within their professions. It's an entire domino effect.

         <br><br>

The biggest problem I have with this (in my eyes) fiendish plan is that they are brainwashing the future of America. The teachers would most likely be persuaded by the book, unknowing that the book has VERY biased sources, usually sources that were tied to the book distributor, and then in turn spew those "facts" to their students. As Ken stated, these kids look up to their teachers, see them as role models and fountains of knowledge. When the teachers tell their students this information that they got from the book, the students view it as hard facts. This could become an endless cycle, where the students would grow up believing the wrong ideas, then spread that misinformation further; it would be an epidemic.

This book cleverly introduces the reader to the wrong area and guides the reader with a view that is not entirely logical. In fact, this is the first time I've learned about the false news that the fossil fuel companies have spread about the climate, but I'm not surprised. In this world, most people only think for their own benefits. But I didn't expect them to shift their goals to the teacher, using the teacher to spread the wrong information to the students. It is ironic that these people would rather spend a lot of money and human resources walking false news than using these resources to research new energy. People usually choose to believe the ideas they want to support. Some people are reluctant to face the reality of climate change, and when they see this book, they will be more likely to believe what it contains. This is undoubtedly terrible.

These companies are pushing their propaganda onto teachers by offering free pdfs of their book. These teachers are falsely informing their students, the youth and the future of the country. The book itself was easy to read, making their argument easy to accept when not fully paying attention. The material is then easily accepted by the young students when in reality it was written in order to discredit the many years of research scientists have spent regarding the climate crisis.

The book kind of felt like a piece of political propaganda that conservatives used only because the climate crisis is considered a “liberal” issue. Most of the facts in the book are false, 97% of scientists not believing in climate change is false, and targets at other conservatives who yearn for a reason to get angry at liberals by spreading “facts” without any scientific knowledge or background. I agree with your comment that the book is easy to read-only because the statistics are unimpressive (as seen during the lecture). Making the book into pdf form for free in order to reach a broader audience is smart though; more people, some gullible enough to believe, can read this not knowing that the Heartland Institute is anti-climate change and conservative.

After reading the book “Why Scientist Disagree About Global Warming”, even though I have already learnt the horrible consequences the human-caused climate change would bring, I was partly persuaded by the book on the ample evidence and detailed reference it provided. The book is well-structured and convincing. It opposed the argument on “97% of the world’s scientists agree climate change is real, man-made and dangerous” and enumerated the weakness of the evidence which is being used to support the argument. Meanwhile, rather than always denying the arguments they oppose and supporting the viewpoints they are prefer to accept, this book pointed the weakness of their arguments as well. “These surveys and studies generally suffer the same methodological errors as afflicted the ones described above, but they suggest that even playing by the alarmists’ rules, the results demonstrate disagreement rather than consensus.” By pointing the insufficiency the opposite side, which is in favor of natural-caused climate change, made, the book will be considered as the objective side to analyze the cause of climate change, which is far more convincing. Nevertheless, although I was partly convinced by the book during the reading, I was conscious after I finished the book and still insisted the standpoint that the human beings are the major culprit to climate change on the accompany of the three weeks’ films, readings and lectures Prof.Ken made. Then, a thought popped in my mind: would this book greatly influence people who are not well-informed about the cause of climate change? The lecture made by Prof.Ken on Youtube solved my doubt. The answer is yes. This book will absolutely influence the ordinary’s view about the cause of climate change and undermine their awareness towards reducing the emission of CO2 to reduce the global warming effect, which is a trick played by fossil fuel companies to ensure their revenue would not being damaged. Once people aware the catastrophic consequences the human-made climate change will bring, they may well choose to take actions to reduce the climate change. Then, the direct casualties are the fossil fuel companies since the demand for fossil fuels will greatly cut off as the movement of reducing the emission of CO2 being promoted. To avoid the nightmare happening, the fossil fuel companies provide funds to fossil fuel affiliates like institutions “Heartland Institute”, to prove the climate change is fake news. 
         <br><br>

Heartland Institute, the creator of the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, targeted to influence the children via affecting the education provided by teachers. Firstly, they offered free access for teachers to read this book. Since the book is well written and offers good evidence, it is not difficult to persuade teachers to accept the argument. Then, school teachers, the most trustworthy people to the children, will pass some skepticism on human-caused climate change to the children, which will greatly affect children’s awareness towards global warming effects. 
         <br><br>

Young children are the essential components who should be in charge of taking actions to reduce the emission of CO2. Once the intention of the fossil fuel companies have reached, the world is at risk of being destructed by climate change. Therefore, supplementing the professional knowledge of teachers about the real causes of climate change are predominant since they will directly influence the children’s judgement!

While reading the book, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I was really just left astonished by the extent of effort that people will go to in order to protect their wealth. The book is easy to follow and well written with seemingly reliable resources. It's easy to understand how persuasive this book could be especially if the person reading it truly has no first-hand knowledge of the severity of the climate crisis. They took an incredibly intelligent approach in planting seeds of skepticism over climate change. The main claim of the book is that there is no official consensus on anthropogenic climate change due to the lack of observational data and uncertainty in the interpretation of data. This is a classic appeal to ignorance because they’re essentially arguing “You can’t say with 100% confidence that climate change is real, so it must not be real.” On top of that, they attack the ethos of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by stating that its a biased organization with a political agenda rather than a scientific agenda. This attack on credibility is made stronger when they point out the fact that the IPCC assumes anthropogenic climate change is real rather than approaching the subject as a hypothesis. We have been fortunate enough to become aware of the science behind climate change due to this class and the fact that we have seen its effects in the lives of others. This makes it easy to see the type of persuasion the book was attempting to use and it just sucks because they distributed the book to all types of people who probably aren’t as informed. A group of people, an industry, really wants to retain wealth so bad that they’ll go to the extent of creating a book to influence masses. My question is, what will it all matter if in the near future the planet is dead.

I completely agree with you on your analysis of the book, which, as you said, essentially plays a key role in persuading the average or nonprofessional reader to furthur their agenda.  What I found very interesting is that one of the main authors of the book was S. Fred Singer, one of the passionate anti- anthropogenic climate change advoators in the PBS film "A Climate of Doubt".  It seems as though, despite the "credible" sources you mentioned earlier that would be persuading to anyone reading the book, there are really not that many outspoken deniers as much as the amount of outspoken believers of climate change.  Even so, to anyone who does not know better, this would be very impactful to their own belief system.  Considering the 30,000 who were sent this book for free were K-12 teachers, this means that it would not only affect the teacher's point of view, but also all of their student's point of views on climate change.  Like Ken said, this would be detrimental considering today's children are the future generation who will be even more influenced by the effects of climate change than we are.  
         <br><br>
For example,  on page 21, the statistic stated that the amount of scientific papers submitted that supported anthropogenic climate change decreased from "75% to 45%" from 1993 to 2003.  Small tidbits of information compiled throughout 110 pages can seem both daunting and undeniable, which adds to the appearance of authenticity which, as you stated, is like a seed of an idea waiting to grow - even if it is false.

Bills like the ones becoming close to being passed in Virginia, South Dakota, and Maine frustrate me to another level. It simply doesn't make sense how governments can say that teachers are wasting tax payer money teaching something that "might not exist" while they continue to turn a blind eye to issues such as melting polar ice caps and consistently rising temperatures, two blatant examples that climate change is present and rapidly destroying our earth. Thats not even the worst part; the law Montana has put in place stating that one giving evidence on climate change must state that C02 emissions have not been proven responsible for damaging our earth drives me insane. We are meant to be teaching the future generation about how to change and protect the world we live in before it's too late, but we are even unable to do that due to policy makers being swayed by big business just to make an extra couple of bucks. I found the reading interesting, however some of the facts presented did seem to be a little more extreme than they may actually be. For example, the idea that 97% of scientists believe in climate change seemed a little far fetched, however, the alarmist stance the author took would be the ideal material to give to children in grade school today so they can actually get a grasp of how detrimental we are currently being to our only home.

After reading “Why scientists disagree about global warming” and watching Ken’s lecture video, I’m stunned that so many people are misled by the so-called experts and are imbued with incorrect knowledge about climate change. For instance, the fossil fuel industries are planting roots of fake information among the future generations, which is merely for their own commercial benefits. Since children are always simple and naive, with little awareness to think critically, it’s always easy for them to be misled and cheated. At the same time, some instructors also do not know exactly what is truly happening around the world as well. So it’s kind of ironic that they’re even teaching the topic that they don’t really grasp, and it’s easy to teach something against the truth to the kids, which will definitely diminish the future generation’s consciousness of protecting the environment and slowing down the climate crisis.

I agree with your comment because it’s important that educators don’t teach this content if they’re not properly trained on it because it can have a profound impact on their students. After reading the book, I can see why many would believe it’s legit since it presents information in a professional, scholarly way which some might confuse with hard facts. However, this book was sent for free to teachers around the nation, which was a smart tactic by climate change deniers. It ensured that the next generation, the students being taught this, would be the ones to continue their practices and continue to support fossil fuel industries.

After watching the video “can one generation do what previous generations failed to do”, I found out that the ways to help the environmental problems are really basic and easy for people to do. Taking public transportation and living in the remote area. First, there are tons of benefits to take public transportation.  Taking public transportation could not only help the climate problem, but also could save enough money. It is really convenient to take public transportation and could help to solve the traffic jam problem. With less carbon dioxide, the air would become clean and it would help to release the global warming problem. So, I think it is easy to do that. Professor also states that people should have less children because the earth’s carrying capability is limited. I think we should concerned about this serious problem.

The article denies that climate change is the result of human action, and refuses to acknowledge that human intervention is the only way to save our planet. People must start consuming at such gross levels, wasting and polluting our only earth. The article tries to argue that 97% of scientists do not agree on the same consensus, thus the statement that 97% of scientists agree is incorrect. I think that the textbook is wrong in nature, and should not be distributed widely as it will only hurt efforts to fix what we have already done to our planet. It was well written however, and it was a little frightening how convincing it was with citations and everything. I am appalled to hear that the institute who published the book are backed by fossil fuel lobbyists. I am concerned about the mass distribution of the book, and the misleading information that is backed by millions of dollars from lobbyists. We need to distribute the correct information to our schools, so that the younger generations can strive with us to solve our species' biggest challenge.

After watching Kent’s video and reading” why scientist disagree about climate change”, it made me realize how much fossil fuel companies invest in having people believe climate change isn’t real in order to continue producing products that harm the environment. With the younger generation believing there is no issue with climate change, they will grow up with no intentions in fighting for change in how we obtain our energy or what we do with our waste. This is similar to how the baby boomer generation does not think there is a climate crisis since they were told that the Earth is fine. 

         <br><br>


Fossil fuel companies invest so much money in to schools, books, and other forms in how people receive their knowledge in order to  protect themselves. With the people believing that the world is okay, they can continue their illegal dumping and polluting the environment in peace. It is important for us as a society to be informed and educated on the current condition of the planet.

While reading, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I couldn't help but notice how bias it was. It is information like this that is published that hurts our fight to better the planet. People who are not informed on the climate crisis we face could read this and believe it and have negative effects in trying to stop global warming. When talking about how they surveyed scientists to see if they believe that climate change was truly happening, 90% believed that global temperatures have generally risen. But, the authors tried to fight this statistic by saying, "They simply asked the wrong people the wrong questions" (14) which to me seems like a very bad excuse of trying to deny the fact that climate change is happening. Even if the group surveyed was small, the scientists being surveyed were some of the most knowledgeable people, teaching at universities and working for government research agencies, clearly these people are very credible and are the PERFECT group to be asking this question to. After watching Ken's video, I think that we should make it required to teach grades K-12 about climate change in all states because this is how we can inform children about the climate crisis and allow them to be able to make a difference when they are knowledgeable on the subject.

After finishing all the assignments for week 3, I think it is really wise for Professor Ken to put these three materials together for ENGL23 students to understand why still many people do not believe the coming climate crisis. For the material of “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, the elder generation do not accept the five simple approaches to mitigate the climate crisis because they thought it violated their American living ways and their rights. They have the freedom to eat anything, live anywhere, buy anything they want. So they do not want to change. In the aspect of “The Climate of Doubt” and “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, these two materials are complementary to each other. It is kind of ironic that people only believe what they want to believe instead of the truth. Even hundreds of documents which prove that human beings are facing the severe climate problems, there are still 3% scientists do not agree with this consensus. Besides, some governors also give their people the idea that “Global warming is a hoax”. This is a bad condition. Because the ordinary people who deny global warming will say, “Look, there are experts who do not believe global warming. This is what expert tell us.” as a contradict. Worse, some fossil fuels companies spread false statements to mislead younger children for their own profits. After reading the materials, I feel that scientists and the government play the most important roles in progressing the “climate hoax”. Because people believe in them. People rely on them. As a result, I hope the scientists and the government could set as examples. At the same time, we need to reflect ourselves, and do not be biased.

I find it interesting that so many are so readily willing to accept the idea that climate change is some conspiracy brought about by 97% of scientists. My question, when faced with this idea, is this: to what purpose? It is not clear to me what all of these educated people would stand to gain by setting up this great hoax. On the other hand, the prize that fossil fuel companies and those profiting from them stand to gain is clear: money. A lot of it. And fossil fuels will only become more valuable as we use it up, making them richer and richer. This is why we are taught to think critically. We must ask who is feeding us information, and what they stand to gain by feeding it to us. I hope that educators also employ this skill when considering what material to pass onto their students. Hopefully they realize that a book that couldn't even sell 50,000 copies on its own merit is something that perhaps should not be taught to malleable minds.

The case of the Heartland Institute shipping out anti-climate change propaganda to K-12 schools in hopes of misinforming children is a clear cut example of the main issue right now facing the advancement of reducing climate change. These people clearly have no ethical or moral guidelines and are willing to misinform the public and risk our worlds future just so they can put a couple bucks in their pockets. It is absolutely disgusting and despicable and there should be more action taken on the issue. The problem is that it is often hard to take actions on these issues because the politicians in office are often financed by these fossil fuel executives and as such we see an opposite effect, as seen in state governments like Virginia that encourage the teaching of climate change denialism. Another important thing to note is that books such as the Heartland Institute's "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" are carefully crafted to be as deceptive as possible. This is important because it shows that the intention of climate change denialism isn't a matter of just objective skepticism in scientific findings, but rather purposeful ill will/evil intentions in trying dissuade the public's concerns about the whole matter. Although the publication of these deceptive books is well within the first amendment rights of the publishers, I do believe that government action should be taken to prevent these books from being implemented into school curriculum.

When reading the book, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I was pretty surprised how convincing they made some of their arguments. I would've have thought an argument about how CO2 emissions are primarily caused by nature and not human activity to be absurd. However, after reading the piece, I can see how many people would have been convinced by it; after all, this is why it was written. This is especially true because these kids are learning about this misinformation from their teachers, people they trust to give them truthful information. These kids that they are targeting are also the people that will feel the consequences of climate change the most. It's pretty despicable to manipulate people to this degree.

         <br><br>



It also surprises me how far people are willing to go to protect their interests. These big fossil fuel companies are trying so hard to keep their money flowing, even going so far to intentionally misinform the masses about an ongoing global issue. The fact that the same people that helped hide information about harmful properties of smoking are now helping deny climate change is funny and eye-opening to me. I feel as though this stupidity is something people will look back on with regret.

As I started reading the beginning quotes of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I was already silently laughing to myself. Not because the comments in particular were funny, but due to who had said them. Each person that had a positive review of this book weren’t exactly climate experts. I thought to myself, “How is the endowed professor and director of Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture relevant to the topic of climate change?” However, some of the other sources mentioned did seem to have some connection to the topic of climate change in terms being geologists, etc. Also, my initial thoughts included how brilliant it was to name themselves the NIPCC because it sounded similar to the IPCC. Any person could easily confuse the two and think this was a legitimate report from the IPCC. Which is why when I continued reading the book, the webpage introducing the book, and reviews, I wasn't surprised as to why it had "good" ratings. The book does a decent job in inducing doubt into the minds of people who aren't already knowledgable on the topic and wouldn't take the time to research if the statements are true or not. If everything was taken for face value, then the book would seem factual and correct. However, as I read it I noticed that a lot of statements that were brought up were never really supported by actual data or credible sources. An example of this would be when it said "The article and surveys most commonly cited as showing support for 'scientific consensus' in favor of the catastrophic man-made global warming hypothesis are without exception methodologically flawed and often deliberately mislead." Statements like this made throughout the book always made me question why that was the case. I felt every statement they made was incomplete and I had to accept their opinion as truth. If I was an average person that didn't have prior feelings on the subject, I can see how they would be easily swayed to believe this book.

Firstly, I felt it was necessary to praise Ken for allowing his students to truly know why they believe what they believe. I find that in many classes, professors frame issues in a bipartisan manner, often not emphasizing that their students should know both sides to the story. Reading this excerpt has allowed me to gain a perspective of a person who doesn’t believe in a human propelled climate crisis. While I cannot agree with this perspective at all, I think that it is important to understand why someone might be positively engaging and agreeing with this information. By dissecting this perspective, educators gain essential insight that allow them to curate information that could help dismantle those beliefs and instill the importance of science. By posing this scientific information in a way that many can understand, they open up the possibility of allowing more people to learn and accept the information. 
         <br><br>
Secondly, this misinformation and the organizations behind its publication and others like it absolutely terrify me. It is nerve racking that the educators and teachers in charge of spreading truth have been targeted and intentionally misinformed. My heart aches especially for the children apart of the next generation who will reap the consequences of this misinformation the most.

This very long reading was honestly so interesting to say the least. I was wondering why people would believe that climate is not real. I wanted to see the logic behind it. And that is what I got see with this weeks reading. The other side has some interesting arguments.  Knowing that they use this logic of not seeing the whole picture to says that climate scientists are wrong for saying climate change is not real is crazy to me. 97% of climate scientist agree that climate change is likely due to human activity. That is a number that the reading says that is not true. Believing that climate change is not real is so astounding to me. Climate change is already hurting and impacting many places like the islands that are sinking or even here in California. People that still do not want to see that climate change is affecting everything is crazy. 
         <br><br>
This reading also brings up the topic of money. It talks about how money is not used in order to sway people to one side of the argument. But some politicians in power right now that do not believe in climate change are receiving a lot of money from companies like the fossil fuels companies. These politicians believing that climate change is a hoax is astounding. But also knowing that these same politicians get money from companies that want to keep perpetuating that idea that climate change is only a hoax has me feeling really frustrated.

After I read this paper, my feeling about the paper is in the opposite sides. Because everything is a two- sided sword. Once it has something positive for people to see. There must have some people feel unsatisfied with. Consequently, we cannot just let the educators to take the responsivity of teaching students in the way that the writer thinks is wrong. 
         <br><br>
Firstly, we should let the students know the current situation of our environment. like the global warming, the educators just need to let the students know the fact of the environment. Then that will be all for them to do. we do not need to let the students know what do should do or force them to do something. 
         <br><br>
What is more, what should those students to do is their options. We do not need to force anyone of them to do the things that we think it is right. Though everyone have the obligation to protect the environment, but we cannot force anyone to do the things that they do not want to do. just like the example Ken gave in his video about people’s division of opinions on whether greenhouse gas CO2 is a contributing factor to climate change;we breathe it out, plants breathe it in, they call it pollution, we call it life.

There was one quote from this part of the book that I wanted to focus on and to comment on because it reminded me of the comment I made for the film, and that is the part that states “questions asked in the AMS survey reveal political ideology is the strongest or second strongest factor in determining a scientist’s position on global warming.” This relates to my comment that I made about the film that I watched where I mentioned that a lot of people follow what their political ideologies tell them to follow, including conservative people denying climate change only because they are “supposed to.” In this book, this quote is used to try to prove that climate change is false because liberal people will only say that climate change is real because they are liberal. However, who is to say that conservative people don’t just say climate change is fake just because they are conservative? I come back to the fact that, many times, it is the (usually conservative) climate change denying people that are the ones who have to search deeply and very intensely to find holes and flaws in the argument that climate change believers make. It seems as if there is overwhelming evidence supporting the evidence of climate change, and the climate change denying folk have to sift through all the big picture evidence to only find what they want.

         <br><br>

Additionally, there are not only liberals who are in support of climate change, but conservative politicians and scientists as well. There is a reason that this issue is not only liberal versus conservative, and that is because there is at least some underlying truth in the objective evidence that climate change is happening. I am really passionate about the fact that people need to be able to put aside their differences and realize that the “liberal” evidence is the indisputable objective evidence that I feel as if conservatives want to deny just because they are conservative and do not want to agree.

Reading the book, I couldn't help but be reminded of a scene from "My Cousin Vinny" which is a movie about two boys, falsely accused of murder, and their lawyer Vinny. In the scene, Vinny picks up a playing card and tells the boys that the prosecutor is gonna take a bunch of these cards (evidence) and present them like solid, three dimensional bricks, and build up their case around these. But the fact is that those cards are two dimensional, and if the jury is able to see that are able to see that the whole case crumbles. The same holds for this book. They present so many "facts", and make them look, and feel like solid evidence. But if you look closely, at their sources, at their true arguments, at their own motives, their case against climate change is so incredibly thin. The problem is most Americans lack the time, ability, or desire to scrutinize their lies, and so they're able to pass them off as fact. 

         <br><br>

This suggests, to me, a duty we all have as citizens of this planet that are informed on climate change. Whenever you hear someone spouting off lies, on anything really but specifically on climate change, please call them on it. Don't try to anger them, don't rub it in their face in a way that makes you look elitist, but don't let them lie. Any awkwardness created from this situation will be their fault for deciding to lie, not yours for correcting them. Don't attack the person whatsoever, but mercilessly go after the lie until you have dragged it into broad daylight, broken its fragile structure to pieces, and exposed it for what it is: morally, and factually wrong. Every lie creates a little friction and thus wastes a little more of the precious time we have to act.

After watching Ken’s video and reading  “Why Scientists disagree about climate change,” I realized that there could be so many texts like this article that appears to be objective but is strongly biased and unsupported. People with insufficient knowledge about anthropogenic climate change can be easily convinced by those facts even though they might come from the same publisher. Admittedly, this company has a clever strategy. The book was written with strategies to convince the audience. 
         <br><br>

More importantly, instead of writing papers and arguing with those scientists and data, the company directly spread their argument to those who do not know too much about the topic, targeting future generations. When the future generations are still unaware of the 97% consensus, their goal of denying anthropogenic climate change for whatever reasons finally achieved since, in the next a few decades, people, who are these young generations today, will not raise their alarm to climate change

"Why scientists disagree about global warming" is a mind-blowing video. Ken points out the specific importance of education when dealing with the problem of global warming. He brought out an example of 30% of K-12 teachers taught students that climate change is a 2-way centered problem. Majority of the teachers are teaching biased knowledge about climate change because they themselves are unclear about the problem. Students should help skepticism in their minds when learning knowledge. Many channels of information are funded by different facilities for gaining profits. Politicians are also using education as a platform to make their own influences. 
         <br><br>
Reading the book full of rebuttals about why climate change is not true is interesting. However, I'm not totally convinced because climate change IS happening. The melting glaciers, the unprecedented rising temperatures, the forest fires, the rising sea levels... All these are indicators of climate change and they are actually happening to remind us our planet is in crisis. The reason why I know part s of the book aren't reliable is because I have already informed myself with some facts about climate change. However, if this article is read by people who aren't well informed, they will easily buy the points. This is way informative and comprehensive education is crucial to the overall population, especially students who will construct the future of the country. We should make education a pure place for fact, instead of a platform managed by different profits.

After reading the assigned section of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” and watching this video, I am discomforted by the tactics being used to promote the agenda of those wanting to discredit the climate crisis. Beginning with the decision of the Heartland Institute to send out 300,000 FREE copies of this book to K-12 science teachers, I am angered because I believe they are taking advantage of group's that can be easily influence. This is a sad tactic to see because it shows that climate crisis deniers are indeed desperate to push their mindset onto the younger generations in order to prime them into supporting the claims against the existing global crisis. Not only have the older generations doomed my generation by being so ignorant to the crisis at hand, but they continue to dig a deeper hole by distributing information such as that found within “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”. Large fossil fuel interests claim that they want to discredit the statistic of "97% of scientists agree with the anthropogenic climate crisis" in order to give the masses a clear picture of what the state of the earth really is, but the tactics they are using themselves are simply hypocritical and seem illegitimate in parts as well. Throughout the book, the approach is to debunk all of the supposed "statistics" provided by climate crisis specialists, but I feel as though the authors just beat around discrediting the statistics and aim at discrediting the ability of the climate crisis specialists to report on the given data.

I agree with you Chelsea, I also found it sickening how they gave away so many copies to K-12 teachers. Its as if they’re shoving it in their faces making them believe climate change isn’t there, and it’s completely sad. Imagine what will happen if the next generations are misinformed, it’ll be a complete tragedy for the earth. Hopefully, we can start changing our attitudes and by the time we make progress in the reduction of fossil fuels, they’ll take action too. There are always two sides to an argument, and in the book “Why scientists Disagree about global warming”, we are able to get the other viewpoint, in the first 3 chapters. It appears that they are simply finding ways to disagree with 97% of scientists who believe in climate change.
         <br><br>
With the various research that they display, they try to make it seem like the scientists are unsure, by saying that German scientists found that climate scientists have deep doubts about the reliability of the science underlying claims of man-made climate change. They try to convince the reader that everything is a lie, and it’s funny since it’s the other way around. They tried to present all the negative aspects such as the disagreement that Judith Curry presented   
         <br><br>
On “Whether warming since 1950 has been dominated by human causes”  “How much the planet will warm in the 21st century” & “Whether warming is ‘dangerous’”. All of this is done to make it confusing for the reader, I also wonder how the teacher would be able to present this book. Will, they include their own opinion, read straight from the book, or simply ignore the climate crisis. I’m mad at the fact that they aimed for the younger generation since they will not know about the dangers of this climate crisis.

I appreciate the fact that Ken is having us read through a prime example of someone denying climate change. It helps to have someone try to challenge my belief in climate change, as it is often said that you can never truly believe in something unless you have had your belief challenged. Reading through what should be the best example of climate change denial-ism, I found many obvious fallacies within their argument. They attacked climate change scientists as people simply trying to make a profit. Not only do these scientists have no way to benefit financially from combating climate change, this argument also bravely  ignores the fact that the Heartland institute is funded by fossil fuel companies. These companies will directly benefit from a continued use of fossil fuels. The book cries that their side is being attacked when they have relentlessly harassed climate change scientists who are simply trying to warn us about our detrimental behavior and about future dangers. It reminds me of the spider man meme where two spider-mans point at each other. However, in this case, it is one spider man pointing in the mirror at himself.

While reading the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” I was shocked at how they tried to disprove that global warming is happening. I wasn’t convinced with their efforts to make me believe that climate change isn’t happening right now, but I can see how others may believe them. Being in English 23, I have learned a lot about climate change I did not know before, but I also had background information from when I had to do a project on the topic in high school. With the knowledge I have, it was hard for me to believe some of the information given in the text, but I can see how others, who have not had the chance to learn about it yet or are researching it now, may believe what they say and start to doubt climate change. This can be very dangerous because if less and less people believe climate change is happening and will affect us soon then less will actually do something to help the crisis. I’ve always believed that I need to question everything people tell me and not believe everything I’m told so I went in with an open mind, but at the end I still felt confident with the belief that climate change is happening. This text was extremely different than other texts we’ve read so far, but I still enjoyed seeing the other side of this debate, even if I don’t agree.

After learning that educators are using that book in their curriculum I am disappointed in the education standards in this country. This also makes me eager to question what has been taught to me before. I question things regardless, but young children are having this information fed to them and they trust their teachers because that is what they have been taught to do. It was difficult to take this reading seriously, or at least not shake my head vigorously at it. It is so concerning that this is the other side of the argument; how can an issue so large be so divided. The scientific facts and statistics are there, it is just a matter of whether or not we listen.

On the surface I can see how this book grabs people’s attention and makes them question the climate debate and the facts and information surrounding it. However, as Ken noted in class, when you start to question the claims this book makes, their own argument appears riddled with it’s own holes and shortcomings. There were multiple claims that made me frustrated or confused, the first already appearing on page 3. They claim that the current levels of CO2 -- around 400ppm -- are relatively small when compared to the Cambrian Period that had levels 15 times greater. While this may be a fact, they give ZERO explanation as to why levels were this high 550 million years ago. Hopefully anybody capable of complex thought can realize that the earth was incredibly different at this time, and life was adapted to handle such levels. Overtime we obviously adapted, but this takes millions of years to do, and at the rate our CO2 levels are rising, we have no time to adapt. The next frustrating comment was that according to the book, issues and disagreements among the scientific community MUST be resolved before global warming can be validated. There are just so many problems with this statement. There will always be disagreement among scientists. It’s the nature of science. To question findings, to refute claims, to build more and more evidence. But there comes a point when enough people are making a claim, and while it may not be entirely proven, it should be accepted as true as most evidence points in its direction. If we waited until climate change had irrefutable consensus among all scientists, it will undoubtedly be too late. This just feels like a cheap claim by the book to make people question the work and intentions of scientists.

After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, what I realized is the true controversy that comes with the topic that is climate change. It’s always been clear that climate change is generally a very controversial topic, given the fact that so many people feel strongly that it doesn’t actually exist and then others feel passionately that it does. However, I feel this controversy just goes to support the fact that climate change is a real thing. The people who deny it are either in some way benefiting from it, or have been influenced by those who are. If not, why would people feel so strongly to go to the extent that this book did, compiling an immense amount of reasons that climate change isn’t a real thing, instead of just trying to make lifestyle choices to see how it actually would improve our planet’s current state? Why not give that a chance? The simple fact that people feel the need to defend their reasoning on why climate change isn’t a real thing just goes to support the reasons it is. No harm can be done in actually trying to make our planet a healthier environment to live in, yet these people urge us not to.

It seems as if after the distribution of the book that described the physical science of climate change, many educators were exposed to the idea of teaching that global warming is actually not real. The discussion about critical denial of the physical harm of climate change and global warming that was presented in “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” sparked a wave of delineation from the harsh global warming ideas that were previously implemented in our schools and in the media. In turn, the young generation of students were taught that global warming was not what it was previously thought to be, and not as harmful to the environment. This was in part due to the media coverage and public education over these young students who are now rallying and urging a generation to look and where it stands in the detrimental effects of global warming and begin to repair the damage.

"Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" was an interesting read. It seemed as though they tried to present themselves as objective. They made it a point to let the reader know they were not with the government. I could not trust what I was reading because they did not have studies of their own to back up their claims. The most concerning element about this piece is that politcians have their hands on this. That is a huge problem because that will only prevent progress from happening on this issue.

"Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is a book that doubts climate change. The article claims that there is not proven scientific change in climate and that  97% of scientists believe that climate change is false. Its clever use of language allows readers to appeal to its climate change denial. It seems to be a reliable source using citations and entitles when it really is only allowing others to be more doubtful about climate change. Having climate activists to be mislead with more false information frustrates me because climate change is real! As Ken mentioned, the Heartland Institutions are targeting students like us with inaccurate information which is very troubling. People and students without higher education can be directed towards the wrong direction and that is very worrying to me. Education is key to this issue and they will continue to target our generation and the generations to come.The youth will be the change of this world.

Since I was younger, I have realized that teachers really play an important role in kids’ life because some of them spend even more time with their teachers than with their parents through kindergarten to high school. Hence, they trust what teachers say and those words may leave life-long impacts on the kids. I’m sad to see that some scientists say climate change is not an issue and not humans’ fault. And I’m worrying about once teachers spread this idea to the younger generation, the kids will not care about the issue anymore because their teachers said that it’s not an issue at all. Just as said in the video, education is vital for climate issues. I'm disappointed to hear that there are governments and people still refusing to admit the damage brought by CO2 and human-related causes of climate change. If teachers and educational institutions don’t emphasize on how much influence climate changes can have on our life or give out misleading information, the consequences will actually be not beneficial for human beings at all.

The article “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” challenges those who believe in climate change with a barrage of rebuttals and evidence. I personally find it lacking in true evidence that could really disprove in climate change as it is commonly known that the climate crisis has a human caused factor. It lacked a real sample size and just as whole, failed to persuade me that climate change isn't an anthropogenic issue. I wish this article just in total... didn't exist.

The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” does a good job on presenting the claim that climate change is not caused by humans. It presents evidence so they can make people doubt that climate crisis not caused by humans. I feel like the book was not strong enough to believe because the same “evidence” was presented over and over again. The evidence were biased and repetitive which makes it unreliable to believe. I have always wondered why they don’t teach young children since elementary about climate change, until I saw this video. It makes sense why during my K-12 years I was never taught about climate change. There was not a single time I learned anything about this problem. Where I learned a lot from Twitter. Social media is a great way to spread the word about climate change. The first time I heard about a whale that was found dead by the shore due to the huge amounts of plastic it had in its stomach broke my heart. Slowly I started searching for more information about climate change and from there is where I began learning about climate change. I agree with Ken that education can play a huge role in deadly with climate change and I am positively sure that more action would be taken if climate change is taught at school.

"Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" gave me insight on how skeptics are able to hold any discussion against clear statistics and scientists. To do that they placed an emphasis on discrediting those scientists and their work. Despite the fact that 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is real, it was almost amazing to see how the authors were able to argue against these scientists in only 120 pages. Though reading how they went about it was almost comical. They mentioned that these scientists, who have done the research and have the facts are only college students, nonscientists with "sloppy research." They continue to question the validity of these scientists because they study different disciplines. Which to me makes no sense, and is ironic because they have been studying in their own respective fields for years, and for them to come to the same conclusion should support the fact that anthropogenic climate change is real, not discredit it. The authors were consistent with their thesis but to me, it was not a good one. What I was also surprised to learn through your video, was that large companies are using this book to target children. Fossil-fueled affiliations like The Heartland Institute, mail this book to K-12 teachers, knowing that children trust their school teachers, and that through this approach they can reach an audience of almost 10 million. While I completely disagree with this technique, I can see that it is also very clever. America stresses the importance of getting an education and has made it legally impossible to not attend school, which should be a good thing. But powerful corporations are taking advantage of this to mislead children with wrong information and children are the future. And some people are falling for it. As you mentioned, "as many as 30% k-12 teachers teaching climate change teach that it is a 2-sided argument." I may be biased but with everything that has been happening recently, like with the wildfires and the coral reefs, and the extinction of many species, why is there still a debate?

This book is beyond frightening to me. Ever since watching Leonardo Dicaprio's documentary, I have a keen interest on the political side of the climate crisis more than anything else. I came into reading the portion of the book that we did looking for one thing, why would pro-climate change scientists are lobbyists want to push climate change agendas? The book had no answers. The furthest argument that it gave was that the IPCC was an agenda-orientated corrupt group. But why are they agenda-oriented? What is there agenda on climate change actually doing to help them?

The fight for the climate crisis is and will be beyond expensive for the nations of the world but it will be for the sake of saving humanity. Looking into the heartland institute and who the funders of the heartland institute are completely disgusted me. The fact that the heartland institute is on the first few pages is astounding because it's so obvious that they are being paid by big corporations and fossil fuel companies. They even hide behind a wholesome name. 

         <br><br>

The agenda for these anti-climate change writers and the heartland institute is obvious- more money from the fossil fuel companies. But what is the agenda of pro-climate changers? Less money? This is one of the main reasons I was very skeptical throughout reading this article, because hell was it convincing. If they gave me an answer to my question I would have bought a lot more into this book than I did. And a lot of what I read did make me angry about the research that is being conducted for climate change, it made me angry that there were a lot of wholes in the surveys and data that we have. For example, the way the "97% of scientists agree with climate change" data was surveyed for was horrendous.
         <br><br>


But even though there were holes, It just made me want to fight for climate change more so we can have a 100% consensus and this disgusting campaign of disinformation on the youth that is obviously for money can stop.

Although I am not by any means an expert on climate change, after taking AP Environmental Science, doing my own research, and taking Ken’s class last quarter, I would consider myself to have a more in depth understanding of the issue than the average person. Because of this, I found this reading to be incredibly difficult to read without being frustrated at the constant stream of misinformation and attempts at debunking scientific fact. Although I tried to keep my mind open and see if I could be convinced by the authors, I could not get past the hypocrisy of their words. Despite attempting to point fingers at “alarmists” and claim they are at fault for climate hysteria, I could not bring myself to even somewhat align with their views. I found their use of the term, “alarmist,” to be ironic, because the only reason proponents of climate change act with so much intensity is because of closed-minded people who refuse to face the reality of our planet. If climate change deniers were not so stuck in their beliefs, it wouldn’t be necessary for environmentalists to constantly point out scientific evidence of the destruction of our planet, which I understand could be seen as alarmist due to the fear this idea may bring. However, this fear is entirely justified and needed in order for any real change to be made. Another aspect of this reading that I found ridiculous was the reference to “real” scientists, and arguing that there is no actual scientific consensus. I don’t see how one could logically categorize all scientists who recognize climate change as a legitimate, anthropogenic issue and disregard all of their research as scientists by questioning their reliability. 
         <br><br>
 Another frustrating point made in the article was the idea that the change in climate in recent decades is insignificant, due to the idea that, supposedly, geologists “scoff at physicists and botanists” because they “express concern over a historically tiny increase in carbon dioxide concentrations” and “half-degree C increase in temperature over the course of a century.” When this idea was brought up, I realized how truly backwards the logic is of climate change deniers. We don’t have “millennia and eons,” which is how geologists apparently view time in regards to the planet. In fact, we don’t even have another few decades. Also, the human causes behind climate change obviously did not occur until recent centuries. The anthropogenic causes of climate change, such as industrialization, were not nearly as prevalent until relatively recently in regards to our total time on this planet. The reason the climate crisis is a fairly recent issue is because we, as humans, have never caused so much damage towards our planet. If we were to continue to act as we do now towards our planet, there is no way we could look back on this in thousands of years because life will not exist as it does today. In all honesty, I don’t understand how someone can deny climate change confidently. Its effects are obvious, and any legitimate research will lead someone to understand that the climate crisis is not a hoax. Although I like to encourage myself to see issues from multiple perspectives, climate change is not something I find debatable. This reading was definitely interesting, but also a bit discouraging as this way of thinking is exactly why our planet is in its current state. However, I am still hopeful that our generation is more progressive than those in the past, and we can tackle this issue, despite those who stay ignorant to the truth.

Marita Noon is hypocritical and an untrusted source. She herself is not a climate scientist and is compiling information in a similar way to the individuals she complains about. Her reference to the curtain in the Wizard of Oz and the need to take a peak behind it is ironic, given the she herself sits behind it, perpetrating lies and misinformation. When describing the consensus of 97% of scientists on climate change, she  makes the vague statement “scientists actually disagree, profoundly and on many points. Their disagreements are on display in almost countless articles in scientific journals and books.” Now, whether or not this statement is true or not is questionable, as she does not actually provide any of these journals or books names which seem as if they would be very important, if they were real. If 97%, or even 50% of all doctors, agreed that a portion of the population to large to quarantine had a disease which might kill all species on earth, but they had a treatment plan which could save many of the people and stop the spread of the disease, they would administer the treatment. If in addition to being able to stop the disease, if, in the instance the disease was not actually present, the administration of the treatment set up a cleaner, safer, less expensive and more environmentally friendly way to administer medicine, this would be similar to the issue of climate change. 

         <br><br>

97% of scientists are in agreement, it is real, but even if it weren't, changing to new energy sources would create many jobs, increase the safety of obtaining power, and decrease costs. In multiple instances, Noon complains how others who aren’t scientists are writing papers about findings, or opinion based articles, yet each article she sites has sources which actually have scientific backing, rather than just the backing of oil companies. The article talks again and again about a lack of consensus, yet shows no sources of the lack of evidence and overall the article is hypocritical and ironic. This article is a dangerous weapon that has been used by the oil companies in an attempt to suppress climate activism by destroying education on the subject, having sent the article to influential government leaders and straight to teachers. In this way the large companies have directly altered the education system and are essentially brainwashing the children of the country. These types of people may be diverting attention, but there is a good chance that when full acceptance of climate change is reached, these people may be punished for their slander, and I for one hope this occurs.

Reading the introduction for the book on their website read much different than the book itself. I felt the introduction pointed out some valid questions that could be used to critique scientists’ studies/warnings, however the book was much less balanced in debate. Reading the amazon reviews made me even more suspicious as I was confused with how people came to such strong, one-sided conclusions. Also, given that the top reviews are from 2018 and 2019 exemplifies how this text (distributed in 2016) still plays a part in influencing the climate change debate. 
         <br><br>
I found it interesting that the text critiques scientists who support of their bias and uncertainty that the authors point out “all humans” have. I think that raises a red flag for readers when reading the authors’ analysis, but the authors write in a way as if that point they make does not apply to their points. Another interesting thing was how the campaign distributed and made the text free plus how states mandate how climate change is taught in schools. Together, this reminds me of how states used to control how evolution was/was not taught in schools. This book is a great example of how we need to digest our information from academia past just the text/survey/source itself.

Upon first hearing about the Heartland Institute's efforts to distribute "Why Scientists Disagree about Climate Change", my initial reaction was that it was perfectly reasonable to promote their book. After all, if their same actions were for promoting a book educating the youth about anthropogenic climate change, many would likely commend the effort and generosity to freely provide their material. However, there is - as I eventually realized - an important distinction between these two cases: one is merely focused on discrediting and undermining the work of others while the other is presenting a positive argument. The book makes little to no effort to address the scientific observations and is instead only concerned with criticizing some of the practices of Oreske, Doran and Zimmerman, Cook, etc. Perhaps some of the criticism is valid and worth being aware of; certainly no one is immune to a laziness and complacency from time to time. As the book advertises itself as, it is about the politics and methodology of authors writing the articles rather than the figures and data within the articles themselves. While this isn't inherently a bad thing, it is a little sad that some will find this tactic as compelling eevidence against climate change.
         <br><br>

Additonally, Some shockingly bold claims from the book really stood out to me; a favorite of mine from the introduction was that there is "No evidence [that] exists that current changes in Arctic permafrost are other than natural or are likely to cause a climate catastrophe by releasing methane into the atmosphere" (Idso et al. xxi). As we have already seen from the 2 weeks in the class so far, there is plenty of evidence that release of methane would be a very bad scenario for the planet. Another remarkably bold move was to make a remark about corruption within the IPCC and assert that there is political agenda unrelated to the science for propagating the climate change stance. The obvious irony in the statement is simply dumbfounding. 
         <br><br>

I thought it was worth noting something about the credibility given to the book based on the fact that it was well-written. Indeed, something with credible evidence should be well-written and well investigated, but just because it is well-written does not imply credibility. Readability of a book simply a necessary part of a book and should play no part in determining the credibility of a source. 
         <br><br>

Lastly, I will point out the silly implication that someone's occupation automatically discredits them from being able to have an understanding about the issue of climate change. I will present the case of George Green, one of the most influential physicists and mathematicians in the 1800s, whose occupation was a Baker. To dismiss his work based on that would be frankly stupid

I was not too surprised to learn that fossil fuel interests are key in sowing doubt about climate change; that the key motivating factor for climate change deniers is money is a given for me at this point. However I did not think that they would be so careful, cunning, methodical, and intensely motivated. I'm still shocked that Republican think tanks spent enough to produce thousand-page reports finding ways to deny the climate crisis, especially considering that the scientists writing these reports likely understand climate change fully and need to contrive arguments to throw the topic into doubt. I am also surprised that these interests are thinking as far ahead as the next generation of children, considering how quickly we as a species will have to act to avoid disaster. It is possible, though, that the climate change-deniers are using the same principles that Ken says are of prime importance in responding to the climate change: children explaining to their parents about the climate. It was incredible to learn that the action by fossil fuel interests run this deep.

Because of the complexity and uncertainty of the climate, doubts about global warming have never ceased. Some scientists have even suggested that the earth is not warming but cooling. Global warming, as it's called, is not just about rising temperatures. It's not about warming everywhere on the planet. It's an average, a long, slow upward trend. The scientific community is also divided on the causes and possible consequences of rising temperatures. The mainstream of the scientific community believes that the carbon dioxide emitted by human industry is the cause of climate warming, so we should reduce carbon dioxide emissions and live a "low-carbon" life. But some scientists believe the causes of warming are complex. Carbon dioxide was identified early in the study as a cause of global warming, but this lack of evidence ignores many other possible factors.

<p>
The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” contains incredibly misleading information that challenges the idea of climate change. There has been countless reports and studies done to prove that climate change is indeed real, and a huge problem our society fails to combat. One of the key points the book makes is that "Fundamental uncertainties arise from insufficient observational evidence, disagreements over how to interpret data, and how to set the parameters of models. The book claims that climate change is based on "observational evidence." This is completely false and countless studies and research has been done to prove the damaging effects of climate change. Another shocking point the book made was "Climate scientists, like all humans, can be biased. Origins of bias include careerism, grant-seeking, political views, and confirmation bias." The earth is warming, carbon dioxide levels are very high, and ice caps are melting at a very fast pace. These are facts, not random statements made by those with different "political views." I found it shocking that such bold points were made without any evidence to support them. 
         <br><br>
I was also surprised that so much propaganda was being shared to K-12 teachers, convincing them that climate change isn't real. Teachers are the primary educators of America's children. Spreading false information can be very destructive to our future. With the current environmental conditions, there needs to be change in order to sustain a progressive future. I find it completely unacceptable that teachers are targets to spreading misinformation. Education plays a crucial role to combating our climate crisis. Once society is educated on the problems we currently face, we are able to make the necessary changes and lifestyle changes that contribute to a sustainable environment.

After reading Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming, I felt very shocked. Throughout the reading I found myself taking a moment to consider if the claims that the author was presenting could be true. Though they were small moments, I was shocked to find myself even having them, given that out of my entire family I am the biggest climate crisis advocate. I was then stunned with the idea  that these books were being sent out to schools and educators all over the nation. Ken mentioned the reports of how nearly half of the educators don't teach about climate change, and those who do spend as little as an hour teaching the subject because of how unfamiliar they are with it. Knowing this, I grew angry at how the books were sent out to push the conservatives agenda on denying the very real and very urgent issues, so they could earn another dollar through the fossil fuel companies. The young children are being taught that the over exposure of CO2 in the atmosphere is helping the ecosystem and not about how it is greatly impacting the environment. Educators are being persuaded to believe that the climate crisis is abusing taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate students, as Ken mentioned, "under the guise of social justice". To me, that is unfair, the children are the future, and they deserve to have a long and healthy one, but because they are being made to believe that this problem just simply doesn't exist, we are robbing them for their life.

I also found myself giving in to the book. I started to question if the information that I had about climate change before was even true. I can see why these conservatives targeted kids as they are easier to brainwash. Especially if the topic of climate change is not being discussed back home. Therefore the information being fed to them is the one they get at school. When I was in elementary and high school the topic of climate change was never discussed, I can not even remember when I first heard of it. Now that I know of it I rarely meet people do not believe in it. After reading this book I got a better view on where those who do not believe in it get their arguments from. Still it is sad to those individuals get brainwashed by people who do not care about their future, but only care about making money off fossil fuels.

The book really opened my eyes to the two worlds regular people face on a daily basis about climate change. Because many of us here are in Ken’a class I feel we are a bit more educated than others on climate change and will continue to develop our knowledge on the issue. However this book has shown the effects that the regular public faces on their information on climate change. Those 3% that disagree with the overwhelming do whatever they can in their power to manipulate the story and gain supporters. This goes as far as bribing k-12 teachers to educated the youth against climate change. They know this is a battle they cannot win through logic therefore they must use money to gain support and manipulate the public. Their use and reliance of money is frankly a main problem of the climate change in the first place. These 3% refuse climate change because they would rather protect their political interest and big businesses in order to MAKE MONEY. Everything with them comes back down to money. If they showed the same care they did with money into protecting our planet then maybe we could have an actual shot at changing the world. Their tactics used in the book frustrate me on a whole other level because rather than using money to persuade people against climate change, for example, they could instead use that money to support different programs, organizations, and movements to change our planet for the better and save it while we still can.

In this week’s reading, I was extremely shocked at the information this book contains. It was hard for me to believe that real scientists were questioning climate change. There were many facts and statements presented in this reading with limited evidence to support the claims being made that climate change is questionable. Also, it seemed very ridiculous that they were even speaking about whether or not the warming of the planet exists and if it is even dangerous. Why is that even a question? Anthropogenic climate change is real and is a proven issue and it was very disturbing to read these so-called scientists question the idea.

I completely agree with you. It shocked me how effectively this book presented information based on very little evidence if any and used such a lacking baseline of credible research to go against what seemingly is pretty solid evidence of anthropogenic climate change. I was also shocked and really found it disturbing that this information was sent to school teachers with what seems to be the purpose of spreading that information to impressionable children to further advance this position on climate change.

After reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" and viewing "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," it's frustrating to see how some people target and send conservative propaganda to people in positions of power and educators about climate change being "not real," which blurs the truth and significantly impacts our society and our youth. What I found particularly insidious about "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" was that it portrayed itself as a credible academic text and presented certain arguments that someone, without proper information, could easily believe. The text attempts to attack your climate change stance in rather cunning methods, such as using deception and misdirections to mislead you from the truth. In general, it saddens me that organizations, such as the Heartland Institute, push for ignorance rather than recognition.  Hopefully, classes like English 23 start directing people to the actuality of climate change.

Reading the book "Why scientists Disagree About Global Warming" had a surprising effect on me. Not because I believed in the information but it made me somewhat question Global Warming and my own knowledge. I understand that this course is about combating this unpopular opinion and pushing for these deniers to stop their attempts on preventing human action on this matter. However, one thing I know about every argument is that there is always 2 sides and reading this book and listening to ken made me question what is the other side seeing that I am not? Ever hear about how terrible your friends significant other is and then later realize that you've only been seeing one side of the argument? That the seed of doubt that has been planted in me was surprising as I thought of climate change deniers to be foolish and dangerous. After hearing ken speak about how these articles are almost always funded by major oil corporation, It gave  some peace to these thoughts of suspicion, and shocked me when I learned that this book had been so aggressively campaigned across america. Hundreds of thousands of copies and the fact that they had sent them to every teacher in the United States was self incriminating. I learned that money is a strong factor and runs governments and political figures which is what happened in many states in the US. It's quite frustrating that these people are going so far to disrupt the studies that would save the planet for them to continue their oil empires.

The sources for this book are not very credible, especially when it is repeatedly from “Heartland Institute,” and the credible sources don’t even support their main argument. It is quite comical that anyone can make a “Works Cited” page with proper notation and the sources are assumed to be legitimate. The authors of this book clearly wanted to coerce the general public and sent copies of false information to influential figures in order to support that climate change is fake. It saddens me that there are still people out there that are so adamant to prove that climate change is false for their own personal gain, when actual people in developing countries are suffering the consequences of natural disasters, heat strokes, loss of food sources, etc. 
         <br><br>
The article made a lot of points that seem very flawed in their arguments. First, they say that there is publication bias and “correlation does not mean causation,” which is true, but also it goes both ways and their argument is not necessarily exempt from this point either. Correlation does not ALWAYS mean causation, and that’s why scientists who specialize in their field have to study it and THEN report their findings if they do find a correlation. It is not like the scientists who agree on climate change are unaware that there is a possibility that it might just be a loose correlation. Moreover, they criticize the false credentials of the scientists that believe in climate change, when their sources are mainly all from the same place. They cannot continually accuse alarmists of flaws in their arguments when they make no effort to establish that there do not have these "flaws."

I was shocked by the title of the book. To us, anthropogenic climate change is common sense. And for me, doing something little for the environment everyday has already been a habit. The first part of the book is composed of many surveys and reports, meaning to prove that the man-made climate change claimed by the scientists is not verifiable. And the book says that almost all of the “97 percent” scientists don’t have the interdisciplinary knowledge to study the climate change in a comprehensive way. But in fact, like other climate change denial books o articles, this book is supported by fossil fuel industries as well, which is designed to make the public and the government “treat them better” for a continuous profit. The book even sent three hundred thousand copies to the K-12 teachers. And yes, my answer is, education does play an important role. When it comes to children, we always think about the future and the better. Their minds are still growing and are shaped by the outside like their parents and teachers because they don’t know that much from a beginning. So, if K-12 children are taught that there is no such thing as man-made climate change, there won’t be any realization or actions. And then, our future is doomed.

After reading the publishing, "Why scientists disagree about Global Warming"  my stance remains the same.  I still believe that global warming is happening and we are the cause.  There is a lot of laid out information in "Why scientists disagree about Global Warming" but you can not argue the changes that are happening right before our eyes.  By scientists disagreeing with global warming it is causing industries to further sell their products making global warming even worse, and soon enough it will be too far out of reach to even be able to do anything about it.  People who are not well informed see this and instantly believe what the scientists are saying and what they believe, rather than actually looking into the facts and actually opening their eyes and seeing what is right in front of them.  A good example is the tornado that touched down in Santa Barbara county.  That type of weather is not common in this area, and the reason it touched down was because of climate change.  Along with many other facts such as fires, rising temperature, sea level rise and much much more.  Also after watching the video I developed an opinion on the education of climate change.  I believe climate change should be taught more in school, and taught with facts and evidence.  I see how it may be skeptical for older generations, to see climate change.  This may be for many reasons, but the evidence is there and it has been there and it is only going to get worse and more evident.

Honestly, I just found these chapters annoying. The authors of this book make statement after statement, that don’t have any obvious evidence, and that are only supported by random people saying, “I support”, or are quotes taken out of context. Everything is written in a convoluted matter to make what they are saying sound inarguable. This is written like the show Ancient Aliens – what they are saying sounds reasonable and then they hit you with the “ancient astronaut theorists suggest” and then it just sounds asinine. Nothing about the manner in which this has been produced has credible language being used. I knew about this document before but have never read it. I still don’t understand why any of this is believable, let alone rational.

After reading “Why Scientists disagree about global warming,” I felt frustrated by all the false information the article was trying to push. I don’t understand how they are allowed to completely  deny that anthropogenic climate change exists. It’s embarrassing that the Heartland Institute will go to such lengths to spread lies and misinformation. I will agree with them on one thing, climate science is a complex and highly technical subject and we should all interpret the term “97% of scientists agree” loosely. 
         <br><br>

I find it absurd how the NIPCC can claim that we live in a  CO2 starved world because atmospheric levels 15 times greater existed during the Cambrian Period. This argument is straight up stupid. Sure, the atmosphere might have had more CO2 but that was around 550 million years ago, humans weren’t even around then. The animal and plant species back then may have been able to live comfortably, but we obviously can’t.  
         <br><br>

I cannot deny that this article is structurally sound, if I didn’t know what I know about climate change now, I would think this information is all legitimate. The citations and consistent neutral tone really strengthened their credibility. There’s no doubt that this book is written well, it’s actually quite impressive and I’m sure that it convinced many people. But, I find it despicable that this organization targeted teachers, in attempts to mislead today’s youth. It’s dangerous to mislead our teachers, the very people who are teaching the younger generation.  I hope the teachers did not spread Heartland’s  false narrative. How desperate are they that they sent out 300,000 copies of this book out? There’s no denying the fact that climate change exists. Look at the current situation of our planet, the rising sea levels, rising global temperatures, increasingly dangerous natural disasters, and much, much more. The last thing we should do is spread misinformation.

in many people’s view, global warming is a controversial problem that need to be debated, because people hold different views on the main reasons of global warming and other climate problem. In many people’s perspective, global warming is an issue that caused by natural cycle which means it can not be avoid, and they list many data in their paper to convince people that it would be hard to fix the problem by human ourselves. However, another people claim the disruption of human being and is able to be fixed if we take action as soon as we can. I think this book it a good example of nowadays debating.

The only word that could describe my feeling right now is "stunned". I was stunned by how fossil fuel industries have planted roots of misleading information in the minds of the generations which we are fighting to protect. It is always frustrating and helpless when finding your opponent too powerful to beat.

         <br><br>

Another thing that I am stunned how well constructed the book is, which is horrifyingly misleading. There are places where author used quotes and data which from an educated student's eyes misleading but otherwise persuasive. It is dangerous how middle and high school educators themselves are not confidently sure the real cause of climate change. One should therefore realize that the students who received their guidance should also not be able to tell the cause. Imagine 30 years or so later, what would majority of people believe the cause of climate crisis?

I was completely blown away that teachers were given this book and allowed to teach from it. Having misleading information being taught in schools is crazy. School is a place to learn. It is a place many associate with knowledge and truth. Children don’t know they are being taught misleading information and as Ken stated, most tend to look up to their teachers and will listen to them. I do not understand how the school district could even allow it. What is worse is the power these fossil fuel industries exert. They were able to manipulate people to believe the climate crisis was a fraud by passing on false information, all to keep their profit going. What is even more shocking is how teachers actually decided to believe the information. “Why Scientist Disagree About Global Warming” shows how easily people can read something and be convinced of its factualness if you throw in some numbers and structure it in a compelling way. I just still cannot get over how teachers really accepted this information. It sucks because they have failed their students and failed as educators.

It was really interesting to read about how all of the different scientists would have different outlooks on what is going on, and it is kind of true since each of them have different specialties. Isn’t there a major specialty though that is supposed to encompass each import aspect of climate science, and use it to be well versed on the subject. I don't really know for myself, but I assumed that environmental science would be the discipline that would be most versed on the topic of climate change. Regardless of that being said, I was interested in knowing why there can not be some sort of task force where scientists from each discipline would come together and pull their collective knowledge together to uncover the truth of the matter. Or maybe we could just create a curriculum that would encompass the majority of the material one would need to learn to be an expert in climate science and be able to understand and see the bigger picture.

This week’s reading, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global warming, really opened my eyes to why skepticism towards the climate crisis exists. Previously, I had regarded climate change deniers as ignorant and politically influenced. However, after reading the book, I understand why people feel the way they do. The book is not overly alarmist or polar so it does not scare the reader off. Instead, it serves to plant a seed of doubt in your mind that grows as you continue to read the propaganda. Even reading the book myself began making me question a lot of things that I previously believed whole-heartedly. However, I kept Professor Hiltner’s words in mind and ultimately did not waver in my beliefs.
         <br><br>

I think looking at the source that founded the book, The Heartland Institute, alone is enough to realize that the book is incredible. In the 90’s, they argued that there was no link between second hand smoke and adverse health effects. They are masters of propaganda and manipulation and will do anything to push their conservative agenda. 
         <br><br>

I thought it was especially messed up how they literally targeted K-12 teachers. They are trying to spread misinformation to the new generations through their most trusted sources of knowledge, their teachers. Since it is being taught to impressionable youth, it will be difficult to sway their opinion in the future due to confirmation bias.

The people at the Heartland Institute and other similar conservative think tanks are exactly as you put, "masters of propaganda and manipulation." The literature produced by them is extremely alarming in how effective it is at planting that seed of doubt. It's actually scary how "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" looks like an actual textbook and if I were a kid reading it I would absolutely believe it as factual information. In my K-12 education I don't think I remember really ever questioning sources beyond not trusting Wikipedia... thankfully I was never really exposed to this information and became aware about the dangers of fossil fuel reliance in my early years of high school. I would hope our K-12 instructors are educated enough to know the truth behind this information.

After reading the first two chapters of the book, Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, I notice the text raised two different arguments among those scholars or scientists. The book tries to convince its audience that IPCC and scientists are biased since they are lack of knowledge to make a consensus on what actually brings to today's climate crisis. When I just start reading, honestly I thought the information in the text was real because it's full of "evidence" and "data" to try to convince us we human are not the main reason to the cause of climate crisis. Later after watching Ken's videos and summarizing what we've read and watched in the past two weeks. I feel like the book is more like propaganda. The context and the so-called credible data analysis are repeatedly written in the article. The audience might feel better and more believe it's not their fault after reading this kind of book. However, Ken always tries his best to make up those mistakes his generation has left and educated us in a great way to raise our awareness of climate crisis and motivates us to find out how can we use our knowledge to make up these climate issues. We are not here to convince ourselves or making us feel better on not feeling guilty on the climate crisis. We are here to hear the truth and be driven to change these serious issues. Our generation needs to use our energy as much as possible to save and renew our planet for our future generations.

When beginning to read, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” I wanted to do my best to stay neutral and actually take what they said into consideration. This task was a bit hard, however I will admit the article is well written. It made me think that maybe if I was someone who didn’t have access to higher education and this was sent to me, I’d believe it. It makes me very uncomfortable to think that they are targeting young children in order to further their own personal agendas. This company sending out 300,000 copies of wrong information that can very well influence 10 million children is mind blowing. With a lot of K-12 schooling comes a lot of lack of funding, and since these books were sent in for free, it makes me worried about how many children have actually learned this information. After going on amazon and reading the reviews I was also shocked about how much positivity the book was receiving. It actually has a ⅘ star rating. I would really like to know if these people are aware that the book was published (and sent unsolicited to high school teachers) by the Heartland Institute, and that they  get massive donations from the fossil fuel lobby. I read a review of someone saying they wish they could send it to Gruta Thunberg. I’m also really curious as to who bought the book, their age and political party etc.

Similar to your attempted neutral stance, I also went in into reading it as the facts were given. The scholarly tone and cherry-picked information do make their argument compelling and even convincing. I can see how someone that is not too interested in the topic may just take the information given by the book as the complete truth about climate change and not investigate any further. This is the reason I foresee as to why the book was sent to K-12 grade teachers. If the teacher had not heard much about climate change, the argument made by the book would be the most prominent regarding climate change in his or her mind. Therefore, it would be his or her truth and perhaps they would be compelled to share their point of view with the students. In addition, believing that climate change is false is the easier way out to many people since it means that there is nothing they can do to stop something if it is not true. Thus, I can see people also believing in the book as a form of denial. This would all explain the positive reviews and approval of the book. The complexity and depth of the marketing strategy of the fossil fuel industry itself reveals that they do have something to hide, the truth of climate change.

It is horrific to me that these industries aim to ingrain climate change skepticism into young children. Although I am obviously biased considering my outlook on climate change and enrollment in this class, this text strikes me as overt propaganda. To me, it is blatantly obvious in its intention to corrupt people's view and perpetuate fossil fuel industry dominance. I was shocked that the Heartland Institute would so shamelessly spread clearly misleading texts. The distribution of this text was not solicited but rather imposed upon people from all realms. I am able to see the effectiveness of the strategy though because it is presented in a way that is intentionally convoluted and thus able to manipulate the average reader. The flurry of complex statistics would obviously seem veracious to an elementary or middle school age student but in reality they are an almost pseudoscientific representation of facts designed to mislead. It scares me that the fossil fuel industry is able to possess such massive influence over the United States. Their corrupting views are injected into Americans from all walks of life, especially those whose opinions on climate change are still malleable. This level of propaganda is reminiscent of World War Two era propaganda to me; it seems so obviously manipulative but I know that is because my view on this issue is largely already cemented on one side. It is scary to me that a book like this can even exist. The popularity of this book is a testament to the institutionalized misrepresentation that pervades American society today. Fossil fuel industries are able to deliberately corrupt people because of their massive financial power and the government's routine compliance with their wishes. I am not shocked that many people subscribe to the ideas presented by this book because people rarely question what is presented to them if it is offered in a seemingly official way. By this I mean that, very few people are likely to question the legitimacy of the sources cited at the bottom of the page. However, if they did, they would realize that the sources claiming to back up these ideas are not legitimate. I am not shaming those who fall victim to this trap though, because I would almost never seek to verify the accuracy of a source myself. The book is preying on people's trust.

This read just made me think of the incredible amount of corruption that fossil fuel companies go through just to make profit. They have a lot to lose so instead they try and convince the public that the climate crisis doesn’t exist. What is even more incredible about this reading is that it was used for teaching material in a classroom. Now is not the time to be denying this issue, instead we urgently need solutions. I have to admit though, if I had no previous influences after reading so many articles about climate change and seeing first-hand effects of it, I probably would have been convinced by this book. It is alarming how many people fall for these claims, which means climate change deniers accomplished their goal. They want the public to believe that scientists can’t even agree on the issue. When they say there’s a 97% consensus that climate change is happening they try to use it to their favor and argue that not all experts agree. There is so much back and forth talk on this matter, but the fact is that it is urgent to find solutions. It is currently a problem in many places; in the Arctic the ice is melting, in Australia fires are destroying life, we see unusual weather in certain locations, etc. Denying climate change’s existence isn’t going to get us anywhere; it is a pointless debate that conservatives use as justification for exploiting the environment we live in.

Blind acceptance of science is a dangerous game to play. An example of blind acceptance to scientific research and discoveries is DDT. DDT was used widely across the United States in the 1970s causing severe environmental consequences. However, when it comes to the issue of climate change, there is nothing to deny or accept. It is happening in front of our eyes all across the globe. The sad thing is how these big energy corporations are targeting the teachers of our future generations and the children themselves. “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” opened my eyes and made me realize that there are so many people in the world who are uninformed about the climate crisis and those who have been wrongly informed. These fossil fuel companies have been huge proponents in the fight against climate change activists and scientists. The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” almost seems misleading to the reader and it is crazy how despite having thousands of pages of scientific evidence, still 3% of scientists deny global warming and climate change. The worst part is they don’t believe it is being caused by humans. Other forms of life do not contribute to climate change like humans, yet they suffer even more than we do.

"Rather than rely exclusively on United Nation’s IPCC for scientific advice, policymakers should seek out advice from independent, nongovernment organizations and scientists who are free of financial and political conflicts of interest."

It's the header for the free pdf of "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming", and it's a statement that sounds like it could hold some water. Politics has always been pay to play, and a political conflict of interest is arguably why our sitting president has two articles of impeachment on his desk... I'm not a fan of special interests.

The problem is, The Heartland Institute isn't staying above board. They aren't transparent about their funding, and when they were, they got dragged through the dust for it, because they got their money from ExxonMobil and Charles Koch. 


It's interesting to think about David Wallace-Wells' piece as a piece of the same literary ecosystem as a piece that claims things like "No convincing relationship has been established between warming over
the past 100 years and increases in extreme weather events.
         <br><br>
" It's not a shock that Wallace-Wells felt like a shock to the system might be necessary in light of the firehosing and gaslighting America is experiencing. It's hard to imagine a calming or subtle response to the disinformation.

Reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” was quite frustrating. I was shocked when the book talked about the 2015 Global Warming Petition Project that urged the U.S. government to reject the global warming agreement in Kyoto, Japan to limit greenhouse gas emissions as this would: harm the environment, hinder the advancement of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind. While reading this I was thinking about a tweet I saw recently stating that “if global warming is real” and we do nothing, it could result in the loss of humanity, but if it “turns out to be a hoax” the worst we can do is better our planet. I personally believe that anthropogenic global warming is very true, nevertheless I couldn’t agree more with this argument for those who are in denial. If we sit by and ignore the warning signs while doing nothing to change, we could witness a drastic increase in natural catastrophes and the loss of animal species before our eyes. Yet, if global warming “isn’t as bad as people make it out to be” and we take steps to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions, earth will be more sustainable. 
         <br><br>
When Professor Hiltner discussed the teachings to grades K-12 I was also extremely shocked. I realized that none of my teachers, even at the high school level, spoke about climate change. I get why religion and politics are left untouched in a classroom setting, but how can those in charge of education youth skip over the current state of our earth? The 2019 Montana Bill particularly caused my blood to boil. This bill supports an extreme point of view that attempts to completely disprove any sort of human caused global warming. 
         <br><br>
After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” my opinion was not changed, but I couldn’t help but think: how many people now don’t “believe in” global warming due to this book?

Corruption. Moreover, targeting minorities of color in their advertisements. There was a piece of writing that talked about how cigarette and sweet drinks companies targeted black people in their advertisements and location. They wanted to bring these people down. People know that these are bad for others but due to the fact that capitalism exists, there will be people that are carrying the burden of other people's conveniences. I have always thought of the quote "on giant's shoulders", and to myself "on other people's breaking backs" that we have the privilege to do what we can do. This is just like the fossil fuel companies. 
         <br><br>
People of power will always target those that are weak and uncertain (children, politicians, those that didn't have the resources to help themselves). This book, like all others, try to convince the readers towards one way. There were unreliable claims and citations, as well as logic. This is a good book to practice criticisms with.

First off, I liked that the reading began with the consensus right from the get go because I didn't understand exactly what the "scientific consensus" was rooted in. I always felt most of these terms were vague and required elaboration and this reading did just that. I always wonder who the scientists are that climate activists refer to and what they actually say as a whole and individually.I was pleased that the reading explained the differences that ensue in what is usually an umbrella of scientists. I've been hearing about this 97% thing for a a while now, so it was nice to finally get some answers. By reading about the many works that are heavily flawed, I realized that the credibility of science is not unscathed. Like Einstein explained that one experiment can make you wrong but no amount of experiments can make you right. I feel the word science alone to some of us signals truth, answers, and logic; however, we rely too much on the word "scientists" to support us in many of our arguments. You can argue that there is nothing to argue about because climate change is just That evident and That serious, but you always have to bring the fax wherever your voice goes. Like the reading mentioned, most surveys on climate  change are based on people who have never studied the issue. This lack of specialization is variable, however, a basic temperature chart to some is enough to display the severity of the issue. This reading does not emphasize an opinion but rather the laziness and inconsistencies that arise in science. Like the works of Oreskes and Cook, there is an unimaginable amount of flaws in works--claims that can not be backed up that lead to more claims that refer to the last flawed claim and so on. You can argue that both sides heart what they want to hear. Climate change is a very serious matter that many of us are wary of, but that does not allow for a lazy dependence on abstracts and other, possibly not specializing in climate, scientists.

Just from the title "Why Scientists Disagree about Global warming", I could immediately tell that this reading's argument would clash with what I currently feel about climate change. Nevertheless, I started this reading with an open mindset, as I wanted to understand the other side's argument about climate change. 

         <br><br>

After reading through the introduction and first three chapters of this textbook, I could see how people with no prior knowledge of climate change would be convinced that climate change is a fraud. The reading does a good job in having readers question the validity of climate crisis; the argument the reading makes is very clearly developed and the evidence the reading provides is developed and easy to understand. After reading the reading, I found myself questioning the validity of climate change... but then I remember the other readings I did for this class, and everything I learned in lecture. This just goes to show how effective this book is... If it had me, someone with prior climate change knowledge question the validity of the climate crisis, what would it do to a person with no prior knowledge of climate change, like children? It is concerning that The Heartland Institute sent 300,000 copies of this reading to K-12 teachers with children as their target for that very exact reason.

Upon reading, I also attempted to keep my own bias out of the picture in order to try and see these issues from a different perspective. This book seemed to be credible, using a variety of citations from respectable sources. Though I tried to take my bias out of the equation, I can’t say the same for those who reported this information for the writing of the book. The sources seem credible, but the information transcribed could very well be biased coming from sources like the media. With this book questioning the validity of the climate crisis, it is very appealing to buy into it. No one wants to believe that the world is ending; it’s a scary thought! Even with prior knowledge, it is very tempting to believe that climate change is just a hoax and that no real damage is being done. “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” made the science look unreliable, and I agree that if I did not have any previous knowledge about climate change, had never taken this class, or perhaps watched a different news channel, I too may have believed this because it seems fairly credible and overall, it’s more palatable. I also find it incredibly concerning that The Heartland Institute sent this to K-12 teachers. The climate crisis is here and it’s going to be difficult to navigate and it’s not going to be pleasant. We have to be informed, and we have to be ready, especially the younger generations.

When I had not begun to read “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I had doubt on this title. I thought it would be ironic on climate crisis, but it is actually not. It is quite compelling in many ways. If one does not have enough insights or strong stand on climate issue, he or she will be easily misguided by this book. It is really irresponsible of the fossil fuel company to spread such misinformation. This book is quite tricky, it is easy to read and it does not hold strong opinions. Instead, it uses a more convincing tone to make people start to doubt about their previous recognization on climate issue. After watching Ken’s video, I find this book more ridiculous. Global warming is publicly acknowledged, but this book is brainwashing the readers, and in some way, it is successful, which is terrifying. It looks that it is supported by scientific data and academic background, but it is full of fallacy.

I am also concerned about the influence that this book may have on people who believe climate change is potentially a two-sided issue or who seek supposedly authentic texts to confirm their denial of climate change. You are right that the tone is not too forceful, yet is convincing, due to its use of reasonable, seemingly objective arguments and assertion of statements as facts despite not having cited sources for them. For example, they state that CO2 levels were high in the Cambrian period "without known adverse effects", which makes it seem like greenhouse gases are not as harmful as it is claimed to be. It is easy to consider this as a fact because of the way that they worded it. So, people might not feel compelled to look at other sources to see that CO2 did affect the biosphere during that period and the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere is occurring at a significantly faster rate now. They repeatedly state other ideas that are supposed to confirm the necessity, rather than harmful nature, of greenhouse gases despite a lack of citations. Also, by discussing government involvement in climate change "alarmists", the authors have cast doubt on the credibility of both the IPCC and scientists. This only makes the statements in this book seem more trustworthy as, opposed to the allies of a corrupt and biased government, they are an independent organization, allegedly not tied to the fossil fuel industry or any other biases.
          <br><br>
It is clear that the tactics of the organization are effective as displayed in the Amazon reviews for it. The review selected as the most helpful supports the "non-profit national research group" over the "agenda-driven" IPCC, as well as the idea that CO2 emissions will not be harmful. This is concerning considering that tens of thousands of copies of misinformation have been spread, disguised as the truth, and there are people that will read it believing every word that the Heartland Institute is saying.

When reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I tried to read this with an open mind, but it is already clear to me that we are going through a severe climate crisis based on my beliefs and what I believed has contributed to this issue. This article tried to push the idea of alarmists throughout the text at various points which wasn't convincing to me. It is clear we are going through an epidemic all over the world. For example, look at our ice sheets in Greenland for example. They are melting severely by the year. This simply wouldn't be happening if we weren't going through climate crisis.

I agree as there is clear evidence for our current climate crisis and not enough time to continue contemplating whether there is or not and being open to both sides. Action needs to be taken now through lifestyle changes and more importantly public policy change, politicians being too stubborn to make policy against fossil fuel-guzzling corporates and lifestyle choices of average citizens. What is even more troubling is that the teachers of the next generation are not putting enough time to correctly teach the terrible truth of climate change. How will the next generations be able to adapt to more environmentally friendly lifestyles if they are not even informed of the current climate crisis and its causes? Ken points out that teachers may tend to do this out of their own confusion on the truth of climate change, thus taking us back to the lack of government support in influencing the public and its citizens the certainty of a climate crisis-caused doom to occur if action is not taken. In my opinion, it needs to start at the federal level so that ideas of environmentally friendly lifestyle living trickle-down into the rest of the country so true action can be taken by us and later generations to come.

When I first read the title of the book I was a little skeptical. Generally most scientists agree with climate change. The “scientists” that disagree usually are using false data to back them. These same scientists are cited by large corps that are doing the most damage as why climate change is disagreed upon scientists. The circular reasoning and mental gymnastics climate deniers need to do in order to prove their point is beyond absurd.  I agree with you that alarmists are an illogical way for climate deniers to prove their point. Education is a key point in solving the problem of climate change and this text clearly is a disservice towards it. The conservative think tanks that are backed by fossil fuel companies  are horrible people that promote “liberty” and “freedom” for their agenda. A lot of people see these flashy words and get triggered whenever they are “attacked” but trying to save the planet and having to make a little bit of sacrifices is not taking away anyone's freedom or liberty and if you think so then should educate yourself.

In the reading "When Scientist Disagree About Global Warming", arguments about why the earth is not actually warming are presented. The book"s main goal is to make the public believe that it is false that 97% of all scientist believe that the climate crisis is real. When I first read the book I went directly to the first chapter and read through skipping all the references after each section as I would have done with any other book. If I had not known any better I probably would have believed it and taken in every word in that book. But when I went back and read the references I was mind blown at how much they reference the Heartland Institute who had also published the book. For claiming that there were so many sources out there that supported their argument, it sure did not seem like it if they basically had to reference themselves. 
          <br><br>


After watching this video, I was concerned to hear that this book was distributed to teachers in order to educate them on climate change. This book is super unreliable and has no strong proof of its argument. Using this book will only misguide teachers into teaching children wrong information. It is crazy to think that climate crisis deniers would go to the extent to pretty much manipulate the thinking of innocent children who will not only see but have to live through the effects of climate change.

It is very interesting to see what the opposing side has to say about climate change, and to be honest, I believe that there are many points that we can take away from these passages. First, the book Why Scientists Disagree With Climate Change does make a good point on what it means to have consensus on something. They have claimed that due to the inherent complexity of climate change, many scientists, who are usually specialized in a particular field, cannot know every aspect of climate change. This makes quantifying the consensus on climate change very difficult. There are legit flaws in the studies which concluded “97% of scientists agree on the ongoing man-made climate change”, for example, only the abstract of a study is evaluated, or the filter word “global climate change” is too limiting, and possibly eliminate studies which conclude against man-made climate change. Second, it promotes a good way of thinking about science—we should be skeptical. Whether or not you support the theory on climate change, being skeptical and really thinking about what you have read on climate change is a good practice. Third, the political involvement in climate science has become a serious issue. One can argue that government and agencies support the science that “perpetuate the lie of climate change”, others can argue that the fossil fuel industry support the science that “discredits climate change in order to maintain its profit”. Either way can only cause confusion, leading regular people like us astray from what the science really says. I believe that both sides have exaggerated some claims that they have made to some degree, and we need to be sharp about them. Fourth, there are many other factors which can influence the climate, such as the Milankovitch Cycles. Due to my own lack of knowledge, I couldn’t come up a reasonable counter to the problem and I hope that this course will help me answer these questions with regards to the science behind climate change.
             <br><br>
However there are many incorrect conclusions from the various studies that supposedly prove the lack of consensus. First, the study (Schulte, 2008) can be discredited using their own way of discrediting (Oreskes, 2004). Second, the study (Bray, 2010) doesn’t prove the lack of consensus. Rather, its extensive questionnaire makes it hard to extrapolate whether they agree on the man-made climate problems. As the questions from the study mentioned in the book show that scientists find them “very inadequate”, they answered very much/worried on the following:
          <br><br>

   “How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?” (Question 21, also question 22, 23 are related to this)
          <br><br>
   “How much do you think the potential impact of global climate change is one of the leading problems for ecosystems?” (Question 28a)
          <br><br>
   “Over the issue of climate change, the general public should be told to be...?” (Question 60)
          <br><br>

   Cherry-picking questions like this can really make you see the opposite, which is what they have done in the book. This study concludes that the consensus is far from unanimous, but it is still very clear that many scientists are concerned about anthropogenic climate change, and this study only shows how much we need to improve on the study on climate change. The next study cited (Verheggen, 2014) also got misrepresented by assuming the undetermined answer as disagreeing. And the rebuttal to Global Warming Petition Project can be found here: https://skepticalscience.com/OISM-Petition-Project-intermediate.htm. While these studies don’t support the idea of “97% consensus”, but the majority of the scientific community does agree on the anthropogenic acceleration of climate change.
          <br><br>
   Speaking of unanimity in consensus, there is a particular point in the book (page 50-51) where it describes post-normal science as science still in dispute while the call for decision is immediate. Some studies suggest to aim for scientific unanimity on climate change, some people are worried that without unanimous decision, we could make negative impact on economy and other aspects of our lives by rushing to make a public policy, but when the evidence of climate change is clear, and with many scientists still oppose it, is it even possible to call for unanimity on consensus in the scientific community? I don’t have an answer.
          <br><br>
   All in all, this book is narrated in the perspective of person who does believe anthropogenic climate change to some degree (see page 14), however disagree on the “extreme view” of that of an alarmist. It is not a complete denial of man-made climate change. This pseudo-neutral stance on climate change makes it easy for people to fall for their preach. While I do agree that having skepticism just about any science is a good thing, their conclusions are still quite flawed. However, having a opposing view can really help you see what is more to this climate change problem and I appreciate that.

Watching Ken’s video introducing the book “Why scientists disagree about global warming,” I feel ridiculous for this kind of fact. Deniers and those conservative think-tanks funded by the fossil fuel industry are denying the fact that 97% of the scientists agree with on and trying to avoid the severe climate condition. Even more, they were and are disseminating the disinformation to a wide-spread population. They aim not only to the influential population such as politicians and business leaders but also children who are being educated. Children are the groups that people acknowledged as the easiest groups to be affected by educators on their way to build complete personality and world view. Those that disseminate disinformation to children are destroying people’s future since the severity of anthropogenic climate change can’t wait for more “mistakes.” People need to change, and the change should start with children. Nature needs help.

In the book Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, there are countless falsifications and exaggerations. Ken warns the reader to “beware” of being swayed by this article, but the stage set by the unmistakable bias in the narration and the whole set up of the book from the foreword throughout takes away any credibility of the book. If you are discussing a scientific issue like climate change, you should have a purely scientific rebuttal. The melange of a strongly biased voice and one-sided political opinions makes this an untrustworthy source from a purely scientific viewpoint. If you go beyond the science, though, I can see how people who already share many of the conservative viewpoints portrayed in this book can feel strongly about its contents and trust the argument presented. The difficulty of addressing the climate crisis is that while it is a scientific issue, the resolutions to this issue are interdisciplinary and can be found throughout, from our personal lives to our political systems. This is where the disaccord can be found because many people, like those in the Heartland Institute, see this as an issue that is not based in science and rather “fabricated” to take away American’s freedom. By boundlessly using the resources on this Earth, they are limiting the “freedoms” of the generations to come. Some of those freedoms including clean water, a stable climate, coastal cities, and so much more.

Also, I was disgusted by the attacks that frontline the website’s description of the book. They begin their case for their book by attacking those who are against it, setting the stage for any others who choose to contradict the work, and therefore inspiring an atmosphere of fear. This way of thinking is incredibly dangerous, and in publishing this book, these people have made a bold statement of apathy and malevolence. It is works like this one that make our lives as environmentalist all the more difficult, and in turn make it just a little bit harder to have hope.

I found book, “Why Scientists disagree about climate change” incredibly misleading and the unsolicited distribution of it done by the Heartland Institutes quite troubling. The book does a thorough and convincing job of presenting itself as an objective, fact-based authority on the “debate” over climate change and flaunts its non-affiliation with any government organizations. The use of citations and references within the text also aggravated me. Often the Heartland institute would reference their own previous additions or similar works, which doesn’t strike me as academically honest or trustworthy.
             <br><br>

But what I found much more concerning than the misleading nature of the text was it’s unsolicited distribution to politicians and teachers. I imagine, to someone who hasn’t had a lot of education of anthropogenic climate change, “Why Scientists disagree about Climate Change” could appear as a legitimate and credible resource on the subject of climate change. It has all the formatting and literary elements of any other scholarly text. But what's so insidious about it, as Ken pointed out, is that the Heartland institutes intent was not to reach the teachers of america, but the students. I think they know much my generation has already been shown the truth about our climate, so they are determined to influence the mind of younger, more vulnerable generations within classrooms.

Honestly, I was alarmed when I looked through "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change" because I was expecting something much more opinionated and op-ed style. I took note of the citations and objective approach in the book, and after reading what you said I agree that the authors labored over creating such a legitimate appearing book, giving credence to their argument.
             <br><br>

I agree with the picture you painted of education in this comment. It is a powerful tool that can be used for good or evil and sadly in this case it seems to be the ladder. This was a premeditated plan to blind the American youth from the environment's impending doom, only to ensure that the rich keep making money off of the lucrative fossil fuel industry and destroy the planet in the process. When I start to think about the main cause of climate change beyond human activities one word comes to mind: selfishness. Selfish tendencies all humans have whether prominent or not are the driving force behind this climate change, and some of the most selfish people known also have a large amount of money, giving them power and influence.

Reading the article was interesting for a few reasons. It was primarily interesting to me because it allowed me to see from the perspective of someone who maybe doesn't have as much information about global warming. The article was convincing, and if I didn't know any better I would consider it a very real possibility that global warming is disagreed upon. The article is skillfully crafted, with great rhetoric, sources, and all sorts of convincing material. This aspect was terrifying because it is targeting people who don't know any better. It's scary that there are people out there, lots of them, who read articles like that and are being continually lied to with false information being spread by the people causing the global warming. Misleading information like this is so harmful, and spreads so quickly. I think this is especially because it is so much easier to believe that a problem like this isn't actually happening. The optimism of climate change being a hoax is a seductive thought, but it's dangerous and absolutely wrong.

The reading “Why  Scientist Disagree About Global Warming” was very insightful since it explains the importance to read scientific articles carefully so they are not misinterpreted and to really check if they are valid. I think the Doran and Zimmerman paper would have been stronger survey if they had not chosen to exclude certain scientist they deemed unworthy to be part of the consensus or had been too restrictive. They were biased by choosing to use only what benefitted them instead of providing everything, including other points of views and counter arguing. I was shocked by the fact that the Doran and Zimmerman paper claims that 97 percent of scientists believe in climate change although they only used the data gathered from 79 scientists they chose to include in the survey.  From the statements about the  Doran and Zimmerman paper, I think the paper does not have any credibility.  I was not surprised by the fact that more papers by alarmist were published rather than those of skeptic science since like most publishers even when it comes to scientific matters they want interesting things that can capture an audience's attention. It is concerning that many of the papers of alarmist are not as credible as they seem, such as when their name is added to several research papers and not having been involved in all of the experiments. I think it would help the climate crisis cause if more scientists focused on getting in less more gathered credible paper published rather than as many as possible. 
              <br><br>
I think it is very important to get input from scientists on the climate crisis who are free from obligation to the government or politics, in order to get unbiased work. It was very interesting to see the comments on the book, most of them either really liked the book and agree with the content or they claim the book is plain propaganda supported by an institution that receives a lot of funding from fossil fuel lobby. The comments are very divided the reviews reither support the book or do not. I think that is how people are about climate change they either believe it or they do not. There are several people who think about climate change as being real, but are skeptical yet they always lean towards one side. I think if people would be open to trying to understand the climate crisis regardless of the government's stand or politics there would be more room for getting properly informed the reality of climate crisis.

This reading, as well as the attached Amazon reviews, really pissed me off. I believe for me the assigned reading served its intended purpose for the sake of this class, it got me fired up, inspired to make a change against deceitful and hateful people such as the authors of this book.  I felt angry at myself for not putting just as much effort into fighting against climate change as these people were putting into denying it.  That sheer amount of effort that was being put into something that is in my eyes so hateful really brought about a new perspective to this crisis.  This made me realize that money shapes this fight.  That companies will be willing to fund large-scale operations of deceit but will not be willing to put in the effort to switch to more sustainable options for our planet. The people that are funding this extensive project are some of the most selfish kinds of people, willing to ruin the lives of everyone on this earth just to make a few bucks and on top of that convince people that those trying to fight for all of us are the ones lying.  
               <br><br>
This article also proved something that I already suspected, and that is that education is a key factor in this fight.  Rhetoric can be very influential, as is clear from the Amazon reviews for this book, but knowing how to recognize a bogus article filled with unsound evidence is the best defense mechanism against climate change deniers and the fossil fuel conglomerates that back them. The fact that the so-called studies and research that backed up this book was almost exclusively the product of the very organization that funded the book is something that is easy to overlook and essential to understanding the fallacies contained in the publication.  Education is key in this fight and teaching how to recognize false rhetoric is one of the first steps.

After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I am pessimistic about the next generation since they are taught with materials which contain misguiding information about climate crisis. People in my generation, I believe, have been taught the severity of the global warming due to the excessive usage of fossil fuels, so that we are willing to devote ourselves to improve the condition of the climate. However, the fossil fuels companies are funding to make children believe that the global warming and the climate crisis is irrelevant to human activities, on the purpose of make a huge profit. It is wrong and inappropriate.

Thanks for the warning from Ken, I can keep critical thinking while I was reading "Why scientists Disagree About Global Warming." The book tries to use scientific data to show that global warming will not get worse. Because of my "critical reading," I realized that the style of the writing in this book is really aggressive and tried to disapprove of ideas about global warming. The scientists, in this book, aim to find the support to show the non-existence of climate change, which is already biased. Also, these data are easy to get if you have a "conclusion" before the researches. The readers of this book are most likely students or children from K-12, so it is not that hard to influence the values of the children before they learn enough knowledge about global warming. 
              <br><br>
Though the book itself is not that objective, it presented me with a new way to think about science and data. I used to believe science is "truth," because science is objective and getting results from the researches, and scientists are serious and responsible for the results they got. However, now I have to rethink that. Science is not always the only way to solve and demonstrate the conclusion, and it may also be corrupted by politics and profits.

So far in this class is that as we move further into this quarter, we become more alarmed about the dangers of the climate crisis and the speed at which it is happening. Education is a powerful tool for every issue in the world, including climate change. If we don’t educate our children about the climate crisis and it’s impacts how are we supposed to expect the next generation to stop global warming and prevent the consequences of the actions of previous generations. 
              <br><br>
Teachers have a huge impact on shaping the next generation, therefore it is extremely important that they bring current issues into the classroom and spark some interest into the children. If we do not teach the future generation about the issues of climate change or even worse, tell them that it is fake and there is nothing to worry about, the planet will become inhabitable for the generations to come. 
              <br><br>
I find it terrifying that bills are being passed as recently as 2019 to stop teachers from being able to teach climate change based on the confusion of some politicians. The first few chapters of this book are well delivered and can easily be a reliable source for people who are not scientists or who are confused about the validity of the claims around climate change. As much as companies and politicians would like to discredit the scientific data supporting climate change, the consequences of it are already becoming visible, with fires, droughts, storms, floods and other natural disasters already killing thousands of people and species. The authors of this book are tailoring the evidence to their advantage and falling prey to their own confirmation bias, they are twisting evidence and only looking at the evidence that supports their beliefs while ignoring the mountains of evidence contradicting it.

I think it is very important to see and analyze the other point of view, however climate change is a difficult one to dispute when the effects are so visible in so many ways and so many places. This papers main points seem to be trying to invalidate arguments pro climate change. For example the paper says it is untrue that 97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real, however there argument is just that it is untrue. Nothing more. Not super convincing to me. I also didn't see many arguments that were new, the article more focused on the problems with how science is conducted and what not.

The fact the people with money are literally in control of the opinions of millions of children is scary to me. All of this false information is being fed to many young brains and is overall having a big impact on the way they grow up and how they form many more opinions. If children are being taught about how climate change is not real, then obviously they will grow up to have that same mentality. As a chain reaction, these children will then tell their children about how climate change isn't real and it will just continue. I know that it is very hard to convince everyone about the climate crisis but I think that letting these big industries run the wya we think is overall really stupid. This makes me feel not safe, it makes me question my own thoughts and opinions and how they have been compromised by major industries. We have to do something about the way we show everyone about the climate crisis. We have to target the k-12 system and teach our children about how their future is in danger.

I find it disgusting that people would spend so much time and money trying to get the american people, children included, to believe that climate change isn't caused by our own reckless activities. The reading showed me that the work clearly took a lot of effort from many people and obviously a lot of money from the fossil fuel industry to create and distribute just to protect an industry that is ultimately limited anyway. The reading itself was well crafted and i did have to stop myself on several occasions and remind myself that what they were saying was obviously nonsense. The people doing all of this are so clearly just doubling down on the fossil fuel industry and hoping they die comfortably before they feel any of the effects of the problem theyre fueling. The reading also offers a lot of evidence that is simply meant to confuse the reader and make the topic itself so difficult to expose themself to they just give up. Having a discussion and presenting both sides of an argument is important in order for everyone to arrive to the same truth, however this isn't an argument anymore, it is fact versus the well crafted presentation of fiction.

This book, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” is strong in its beliefs: “The global warming movement is the most extensive and most expensive public relations campaign in the history of the world,” the forward begins. It serves to convince you that science is differently than what you have been taught, that that, in fact, the claim that 97% of scientists believe in climate change is false. It’s very carefully constructed, as Professor Hiltner emphasizes, and it is unnerving how well it changes facts. It convinces the reader that environmentalists only serve to line their own pockets. But I firmly believe that nothing happens in a bubble. We cannot be as ignorant as to believe that changing our planet does not have any long term effects. It is important to read very carefully into what is in front of you.

Not sure how much the authors were paid, they just take shamelessness into a whole another level. I am triggered by the fact that such unreadable texts came from a book, the writers should make more efforts on how to write scientifically. They certainly put their time and efforts on finding and collecting the little bit of "evidences" that supports their narrow point, and perhaps looking for ways to distribute the copies to influence the younger generation. This is not science nor a study about science, but poorly written propaganda that bullies the younger mind that will easily accept what it delivers.

This book is quite alarming and frustrating, not only in the way it endorses climate change denial, but how it mis portrays scientific research. The book claims that scientists are too specialized to understand the whole picture, when the reason we can understand part of the picture is that scientists are specialized.  No one person can know everything about everything, that is why we specialize, but there is a deeper, more fundamental process in science that this book misses, collaboration. Scientists know when their area of expertise is being tested and they either try to figure it out or they talk and collaborate with others to figure out the answer. Therefore, on big scientific papers you could see a mathematician working with a physicist or a chemist working with a biologist or geologist, or so many different options. Science is meant to be collaborative and involve many points of view and this book makes that seem like a weakness. To take their own analogy imagine is the men touching the elephant could talk to each other while doing it, they have a large possibility of getting the right answer. 
              <br><br>
It is also alarming how they say fossil fuel companies do not contribute any money to the Climate Change denier side, yet they partially control the distribution of the very book they make these claims in. The hypocrisy is monumental, and I found the arguments they made were very face value. In fact, I think I could sum up everything I read in a single chapter. Also, to me the formatting seemed off. Usually, when a figure is used in a scientific paper, it is a graph or picture that explains the findings, the figures in this book were bullet points, almost something I would expect from an outline or draft and not a figure. When I looked at the book, it seemed off to me, but to others it can look very convincing and that is the scariest to me.

After reading the first three chapters of the book, "why scientists disagree about global warming" I came to to the conclusion that most skeptics just try to prove believers of climate change wrong by pointing out their shortcomings instead of having concrete evidence that climate change is occurring due to natural reasons rather than anthropogenic reasons. It was just saying how most information about climate change is false and meaningless, surveys are flawed and opinionated and that carbon dioxide plays little of a role in global warming. I'm glad that you brought up conservative think tanks in your video because I really do believe that these people such as president Donald Trump pay others just so that they have something to rely on when they get overwhelmed by people with proven evidence that climate change is real. I find it really funny how in the book it was talking about how skeptics don't get published as often as believers do and that their resumes can't compete. They're basically just complaining that they're not as successful as the believers are and why would they if the only people who support them are the big corporations which in the end does not make them a credible source of information if the majority of the population thinks that climate change is real. It goes on to tell the reader that most alarmists make assumptions which cannot be made as conclusions because they're not actual scientists so they shouldn't be trusted. After reading this book, my stance on climate change has remained the same and I am still a firm believer.

This week’s reading was a tough one. The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” really tries to challenge your ideology about climate change. For instance, I wholeheartedly believe in climate change as I have seen many of the ones I love suffer the consequences of our actions. However, while I was reading these chapters, I constantly would doubt myself about my beliefs on climate change. They did not convince me that climate change was a product of my imagination, but it made me think about other people around the world who might not be as informed as I am about this issue. Some people are really susceptible to this kind of texts and I cannot blame them. This book is crafted in a way that makes you think about this global issue. 
              <br><br>
One I thing I found ridiculous was their argument that because climate change is such a big subject, no scientists could possibly understand the severity of the problem. First of all, I do agree that climate change encompasses many fields in science, but that’s the beauty of it. Due to the mixture of different subjects, scientist for around the world can come together as one and collectively deal with this issue. Yes, there might be disagreement between scientists but that is great. Debates generate new ideas that could be used towards helping understand this crisis in better way. This is like everything in life. A chemist can synthesize new drugs that could be useful in the medical field, but it wouldn’t be as efficient as if they hadn’t study biology and human physiology as well. The chemist would need a biologist, a doctor and other people from different disciplines to successfully deliver this new drug. Climate change cannot be solved by one person, by few scientists. It is rather a collective task between non-science majors and science majors to formulate a cure to our planet’s disease. 
              <br><br>
 Lastly, there is another thing that bothered me about Heartland Institute. They make it seem as that they are innocent angels. They attack scientists and those who believe in climate change by claiming that they accept money from politicians to support their policies. However, I am sure that the Heartland institute itself is acquiring large sums of money by the fossil fuel industry by spreading all this false campaign that climate change is fake news. Once example is by strategically targeting teachers across the U.S. If the teachers are brainwashed, then they will transmit their new ideas to their students. This is dangerous because these students would be vulnerable and susceptible to these ideas. They will lead this world in the future and if they get brainwashed, then there might be little hope for us. However, I also believe that today’s kids are smarter than we were back then. They are capable to overcome this.
              <br><br>
 I will say though, this book challenged me in way I thought it wouldn’t be possible. That is what I liked about it. I might’ve not liked their arguments but the way it made me feel was completely strange to me. I feel that we should always be opened-minded about everything in life, whether is something we like or not. After all, we always learn new things that we can use to our advantage and future reference.

I completely agree with many of your points. For one, the idea of the Climate Crisis being such a large issue being a good thing is perfectly stated I feel. As you said, this provides the opportunity for the best minds of the world to try to tackle such an issue. The scientific front would include chemists, biologists, and many engineers that could synthesize new technology and new methods of say, production that can lower carbon emission levels. But this will not be limited just to the scientific sector. This can include many economics and busines experts, who could bring in these new scientific processes into business sectors. As we have learned in this course, big business such as factories and the meat sector takes up most of the carbon emissions in the world. If businessmen can sell these large corporations on the idea of greener processes, as well as helping the scientists themselves limit costs to increase bottom line, there could be giant leaps into a greener future. 
              <br><br>

But, there are corporations and businesses that will help sources like the the Heartland Institute who continue to contribute to the denial of climate change for corporate benefit. Big Oil and Fossil Fuel companies want to continue to fight climate change activisits because it would interrupt with their bottom line. They already pay big dollars to back political candidates who promise to fight any green tax (such as a carbon emission tax) and green deals that limit corporations on their production levels and processes. These companies produce in the cheapest way, not the best way. If climate change activists win in their battle, they would have to succumb to all these nature-friendly laws and limits. This is why it is in the best interests for these corporations to fight and continue to deny climate change. It is a definite sad and moral violation, as they are not even thinking of the future of Earth, or their kids, but to the greed of money. There needs to be a halt on their power.

<br><Hr>
 I really appreciated many of the points in your response. I whole-heartedly agree with the fact that scientists must have to collectively come together to understand the severity of the climate crisis. As a believer of the climate crisis, I found this part of the reading extremely ridiculous. Isn’t better to come to a scientific understanding even though there are many different viewpoints? Isn’t that more valid and reliable? Saying that the climate crisis is too large and complex is definitely a copout. In addition to this, bigger corporations that are involved with the carbon emission fuels pour a lot of their profits into making sure that government officials do not create a carbon tax, and are ideologically against climate change. There is a mutual interdependence between these higher powers within society, which is why the climate crisis has gotten as bad as it has. At the end of the day, money is a driving force for these corporations, and they’re not willing to give it up, even if it’s detrimental to our planet as a whole. This unfortunately is today’s reality. If they instead use their profits to come up with a “green” production process, then there could be a way to solve the crisis. In this case, it’s hard to say that they would even think to do this.

In reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," I found it interesting how the NIPCC aims to characterize the IPCC and UNIPCC as fundamentally corrupt. These conclusions are drawn from money supplied by the government to 'support' conclusions on human-caused climate change, whereas the corporation funding the article's creation, the Heartland Institute makes it a point to not only directly call out the supply of non government funds, while leaving out private investments into this issue. In reading a piece as created by the NIPCC I believed that I would be almost immediately be able to point out and dismiss this report relatively quickly, as a self pronounced believer in man made climate change. This wasn't immediately the case though as intriguing points were made in regard to Oveskes study and the specific term of "global climate change" and analysis of abstracts, and Doran and Zimmerman's pool of surveyed individuals and relatively leading questions. This had me for a minute question the validity of some of the information put forward by climate change caused by human groups and researchers. The NIPCC also interestingly addressed the 97% of scientists consensus and the information stemming from that in in 'could' be significantly lower according to their data. While concrete in their stance about the perceived role of the IPCC furthering their agenda, and that climate change is 'natural,' when addressing ideas about climate change and what it's caused, language such as "probably" and "likely" were utilized. While in line with their ideas that their maybe different approaches to such causes of climate change, often times with NIPCC missing the big picture, there were no resounding conclusions supporting a different theory past what they were poking holes into with the IPCC.

This intro served as a reminder and revelation for me as I already knew that countless fossil fuel industries have developed facades like the friends of science to try and counter the idea of climate change, on the other hand, I didn't know that they had sent thousands of copies to K-12 teachers of books that would attempt to convince American educators against climate change. This action reminded me of things like military recruiters and different religious missionaries who would many times visit underserved neighborhoods and schools to convince either children or adults to convert or join their causes. In relation to Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change, I feel that their main argument was relatively ironic since they constantly ridiculed the sources they investigated by stating that either they weren't completely qualified because they were still students earning their respective degrees or because they used resources like google scholar to add to their research. What I found most displeasing about this was the fact that they constantly talked about what they didn't have in relation to credentials instead of what they produced and brought to the debate surrounding climate change. This book made it feel like if the debate around climate change was only for the privileged. Only if you have acquired the proper credentials and are adept in the field chosen by our authors is what it seemed the book focused on. referring back to their use of Friends of Science as a reference on 'scientists' who do not believe in climate change a simple google search on their funding reveals that they are funded by various fossil fuels companies and really makes you wonder whether their opinion is biased or not. In addition to this, the book also provides references at the end of each study they critique as to further affirm that they have indeed done their research making it pretty clear to an intuitive reader that this all might just be a bunch of jargon. 
               <br><br>

Overall, this book kind of reminds me of that saying about finding a needle in a haystack. It's ironic that in the second chapter when they are providing evidence to discredit there being a common consensus I feel that they discredited a consensus by filling the opposing opinion with mounds and mounds of counter research would make you second guess the idea of there being a needle in the first place. If you look at the way that they provided their findings yo would see that if they believe that the opposing opinion is picking and choosing what they believe in then looking into what they show is laughable and bias. In their analysis of Dennis Bray and Hans Von Storch's study, the evidence they provided of there not being a consensus involved focusing on the top and low ends percentages. for example, they showed that the lower half of people who believed in the provided questions to be inadequate were higher than the half that believed that it was, therefore, the bottom half was correct. this in part leaves the middle to receive a lack of recognition. Or for example, the author's opinion on the role of the scientific method in the consensus around climate change is that the definition of climate change focuses on the idea that it is caused by humans and not nature directly. In the end, after looking through reviews and the Heartland Institutes summary on the book which is another company surprisingly funded by fossil fuel companies and very generous anonymous donors the books bias is pretty clear and shows how easy it is to manipulate people into not believing in something by providing 'evidence' like on amazons reviews where people commented that they worked in such and such field validating their POV and then going on about how this book is completely true.

-       I did not want to believe the points in this article when I began reading but indeed the authors did bring forth good reasons that go against the beliefs on climate change. One point that really stood out to me was in the beginning of the second section when they said “climate is an interdisciplinary subject requiring insights from astronomy, biology, botany, cosmology, economics, geochemistry, geology, history, oceanography, paleontology, physics, and scientific forecasting and statistics, among other disciplines.” They then presume to say that it is rare for scientists to be complete experts on multiple subjects which is sort of an alarming note when you analyze the number of subjects involved in the climate crisis science. 
               <br><br>
-       I think going from here this comment makes it evident that scientists from different fields, the population, and governments should all be working TOGETHER rather than trying to make their points for climate change more important than each others. It is going to take a lot of knowledge and testing ideas to find a cure for this mess.

"Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is kind of biased, because it doubt everything about the global warming. Also, the writers didn't give any evidence or studies to support them. They didn't explain why scientists have different opinions on global warming but pointed out the findings of other publishers were invalid because of wrong ways obtaining data. From recently wildfire to the melting of ice-mountain, it is obvious that the climate is changing and the global warming is getting worse. Teachers use the books of those writers and gives students wrong knowledge about the global warming which is terrible, since education is critical in prevent global warming. We need to let our children pay more attention on global warming, so that they can create a better place to live.

While reading the assigned chapters from the book entitled “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming”, I believed that it brought up some valid points as an argument to the climate crisis. I was even more intrigued to see some validity to its claims because the authors included sources for at least some of their arguments. Upon further inspection however, the sources can almost be completely dismissed because of where they came from. While they may have come from from “trusted” sources, using them as a source in this regard does not actually give them much credibility because of the kind of people that report the information. Using sources from media especially, such as The Wall Street Journal, can be biased in the information they give so their credibility is questionable. I really want to think that maybe this climate crisis is not as bad as people make it out to be. But unless an unbiased and credible source can tell me otherwise, with a strong contradiction, I have no other choice but to accept the fact that we really are in a crisis.

While reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”,  it kind of scared me how convincing it was. I was so against it going into the book, but it somehow had me questioning things for a minute. Just for a minute though! There's way too many things happening that prove we are contributing to climate change and what it's doing to our planet. I was baffled when Ken mentioned how many teachers there are out there that have the audacity and guts to be teaching young and easily-influenced children that all these disasters are natural. I couldn't believe it when Ken also said that these ignorant teachers can potentially be teaching up to 10 million children that will grow up thinking this is all normal. Those 10 million individuals could possibly make quite a positive change if only they were being served correctly with proper facts and knowledge. These teachers surely need a reality check before they create more irreversible damage by backing up these horrible fossil fuel companies that only care about their well-being.

After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I was totally shocked by the fact that there are still a great deal of scientists failed to recognize the gravity of the climate crisis and even denied its existence. The text mentions that “Extensive survey data show deep disagreement among scientists on scientific issues that must be resolved before the man-made global warming hypothesis can be validated.” This raises a great concern since human do not have enough time for the scientists to argue about who is right or who is wrong before the end of the world comes. Scientists should stand their ground and lead more people to realize the situation, directly facing the problem. No matter the global warming is caused by humans or not, let people pay more attention to the topic is harmless. Besides that, I think giving this kind of book to teachers and students is absolutely wrong. Students need to be led correctly when they are unaware about what is happening in the world. Believing in climate change is really significant for saving the future world and more solutions need to be provided. If the young couldn’t even realize the environmental issue, how could they support or contribute to the solution.

Similarly to an opinionated news article, I was a bit surprised to find the book, in a way, “attack” claims or opinions that went against the claims of the book; for example, “scientific consensus is an abstract counting exercise by a wacky Australian blogger named John Cook.” Most formal books or academic papers that I’ve read never really do that. Despite the attacks, if I wasn’t prefaced with the fact that the book is very deceiving in the points it made, I would’ve had no idea. More specifically, I took a long gaze at the statistics they presented, which was only 41 of 11,944 abstracts saying that they agreed since 1950 climate change is mainly anthropogenic. Even after I read it, I’m still curious as to how they gathered that information or if they used some kind of loophole that made them valid in presenting that statistic. However, other things like saying how the surveys didn’t look into the political stance of participants made me skeptical because it made me think they were trying to knit-pick at anything they could find that would add to their argument.

While reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” I listened to Ken’s advice about staying aware of how much the article attempts to direct your ideas about anthropogenic climate change. At the same time I wanted to have an open mind and listen to the arguments made in the article without an unfair reading bias. The article immediately comes off as aggressively manipulative however. The author clearly has no interest in conveying scientific information, but rather attempts to push a specific agenda.
              <br><br>
the fact that the article was published by a fossil fuel affiliate is incredibly obvious when reading it. The information they share about scientific opinions directly contradicts other information I have read. It is clear that the authors were trying to change and shape readers ideas to feel more comfortable with the topic of climate change. 
              <br><br>



I was shocked to see how polarizing the topic of climate change is among readers. I was always under the impression that most people believed humans have an influence on our climate. Every time I have discussed climate change with someone I know, we agree that human actions directly affect our climate. After reading the amazon reviews however, it is clear that there are many people who believe both sides. The comments are almost all either 5 or 1 stars, showing just how divided people are on the topic. This shows just how well biased propaganda like this works on shaping a societies ideas.

I agree with you about the article being immediately, forcefully manipulative and causing me to start reading with skepticism. The whole article, as you state, is intended to influence the audience to “feel more comfortable with the topic of climate change” which is absolutely disgusting to me. It is mind boggling that fossil fuel affiliates, organizations like the Heartland Institute, would rather drive in a profit by fiending off over America’s rampant consumerism and enjoying the comfort, rather than caring for the comfort of our future generations. 
              <br><br>
The fact that 300,000 free copies were distributed to keystone figures in the future of sustainability, such as teachers and business owners, reveals that the authors are willing to misinform hundreds of thousands of people, stalling environmental progressivism in a significant way. This wasn’t just an innocent act of marketing, this was a purposeful strategy to sway America towards a majority of climate change deniers; the free copy receivers didn’t even order the book, but it is so deceptive that it is difficult to read it with an open mind if you aren’t already educated on the topic. I appreciate your insight on the Amazon reviews for this book. I definitely think climate change is a strict “yes” or “no” debate, partly because if one shares that they somewhat believe in anthropogenic climate change, it is equivalent to admitting that you acknowledge human blame and choose to stay action-less. I find that climate change has a similar dynamic to politics; there is a deep divide and supporters stick by unshaking beliefs.


<br><hr>

As I was reading the article, I also got the same feeling of the authors seeming aggressively manipulative. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they did do a very good job of framing their arguments to sound extremely convincing. There were certain points where I almost was skeptic myself, despite normally being a very strong believer that we are well into the climate crisis. I noticed, though, a certain tone throughout the article that felt almost as if they were talking down to me for believing in climate change (there was a string of rhetorical questions in chapter 2 that seemed as if they would attack anyone trying to answer them). The attitude shining through the pages helped bring me back to reality and realize, as you said, that they’re very obviously trying to push an agenda. When Ken said that groups that typically write these types of articles are funded by fossil fuel companies, it wasn’t much of a surprise. If they truly had strong evidence to back their claims, they wouldn’t feel the need to sound so aggressive just to get try to get their points across.

I am just absolutely disgusted with this movement of climate change skepticism. These politicians know how to appeal to the uneducated in a deceptive way. But I was able to pick apart alot of the text. First of all two quotes from the text stood out to me as just a basic and complete misunderstanding of environmental justice. One, "A warming of 2°C or more during the twenty-first century would probably not be harmful, on balance, because many areas of the world would benefit from or adjust to climate change" and "Individual nations should take charge of setting their own climate policies based upon the hazards that apply to their particular geography, geology, weather, and culture". One, addressing the first quote, this has been disproven. Areas such as Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Paradise are already at or above 2C and have seen some of the biggest wildfires ever seen in California history. Looking at the Thomas or Campfire Fire, there was no 'adjust to climate change" as the text suggests. Only one option, evacuate. These are rich areas too and they did not have the means to adjust to this large, fast, and widespread of a wildfire (and the warming accelerated all of these factors significantly). Two, the second quote says each area should adjust acoording to its risk. Are you actually kidding me? The poorest areas contributed the least (5% of the poorest 3 billion) and will be affected the most while the rich benefited from fossil fuels and have more wealth yet contributed to the crisis the most and you are telling me the poor areas its their job to bawd "upon the hazards" that apply to them? I am not even sure why equality is an ideal in America because we are the opposite of equality. We have no moral grounds and our political system is corrupt with those who are willing to do anything to keep their wealth.
              <br><br>
The uneducated won't catch their flaws but I do. The text said this: "Earth has not warmed significantly for the past 18 years despite an 8 percent increase in atmospheric CO2, which represents 34 percent of all extra CO2 added to the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution". But I know that CO2 has a significant time delay in its effects on the atmosphere. The warming we are experiencing is not from today but many years ago. This is a flawed statistic. 8% inc in the past 18 years and no significant warming? This isn't a valid point considering CO2 takes from when it goes to the atm to have a noticeable effect on climate. This is just another example of them not actually knowing science, they are manipulative politicians who try and use 'data' to screw with the public opinion. They did this with cherry picking points on a 10 year time period graph of temperature increase saying we are actually cooling. It is so damn ridiculous and a use of misinformation that I think is jail worthy.
              <br><br>
Lastly, it is so sad, as seen in Ken's video, that they are targeting children and the education system. First it is eye opening that they had to give so many free copies (showing how bad they wanted this to spread). Its really sad seeing teachers being convinced by this, and getting the statistics wrong in what percentage of scientists believe anthropogenic climate change is real (and the range was as low as 81 and up to 100). They are having an impact as smart politicians. My mind was blown was it was discussed that the topic of tabacoo had a similar backlash like global warming is. And it is funny that conservative think tanks who got money from the tabacco industry were involved in hiding the truth about the harms of it, the exact same thing is happening with climate change, those who get money from the fossil fuel industry (like the KOCH brothers funding the Heartland institute) will do anything to keep their money and power. This motive to deceive is so obvious, they say that the IPCC is corrupt and has an agenda, but that is so ridiculous since this "nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change" has so many players funded by fossil fuel interests.

Initially entering this book I was a bit suspicious of it. I remember previously reading about "think tanks" that are funded by major oil corporations for the purpose of creating arguments against climate change. Sure enough I was proven correct once I started reading it. The portion we were tasked to read this week focused especially on denying the notion of "97 percent of scientists agree on climate change" They did so by trying to tear apart the arguments of several scientists. It was also done so in a very strategic way such as one of the arguments being that someone only cited abstracts instead of looking through the entire article. Reading through it I tried to picture it through the guys as an educator as in the video it was stated that 300,000 copies of these books were sent to teachers in order to sway them to the anti climate change side. I was very alarmed when I saw that this could theoretically teach up to 1 million children that climate change is a hoax. Looking at the reviews as well I was surprised to see that any comment that was saying something in argument to the book was rated very low stars. It is very interesting to view this and wonder if perhaps this was done intentionally in order to have people read it. Also offering it as a fre and public pdf online was also a smart way to spread this information as it could reach so many more people that way. Regarding the reading itself, however, it seemed hellbent on finding any reason to discredit people supporting the anthropogenic climate movement.

I think you took away the most important aspect of the article “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" which was the power of these think tanks. In my economics class, we learned of the power of these think tanks during the 2008 housing collapse. In this instance, the powerfull wall street investment banks paid to think to justify the unstable investment practices they were engaging in. This system paid out millions to top economics professors across the ivy league circuit who in turn changed the study of economics to match their claim that these practices were both safe and beneficial to the economy. I truly hope these fossil fuel executives do not get away with their crimes the same way wall streek bankers did 12 years ago. The existence of this article alone hurts the reputation of the scientific community and if taken seriously discredits any other theory that has a strong scientific conscience. We have allowed money to control all fabrics of life and its power outweighs facts themselves.

It is very interesting to see that the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" seems to be a "reliable" source with all those citations, entitles, and dedication, but in fact not credible at all. The book presents readers wrong information that global warming is actually not a problem at all, and only focus on scientists who take the 'disagree' side. However, completely ignore all those scientific articles wrote by scientists who agree about global warming and provide with solid evidences. The fact is this book did not include any solid statistical evidence to prove the argument that scientists disagree about global warming. It seems to me that the book is published under certain aim to overturn the fact of global warming crisis to gain interest of some groups. It is horrible to think that books like this will implant this kind of terrible misinformation in readers' mind. If this book was promoted and unfortunately believed by most of it readers, it is hard to image the consequence. 
              <br><br>

Luckily we have the ability to question the reliability of the source and we are educated that global warming is in fact changing the world dramatically. Still, I feel really bad that under current situation, there are people have to escape from their own houses because of global warming, people who died because of global warming, and species extinct because of global warming, but there are still large proportion of people who stand up against the theory of global warming, disagree that climate crisis is actually happen. But I always keep positive on the future since college students are educated that we have to take actions to protect our Earth, and book like this obviously will not persuade us that global warming effects do not exist, but on the other hand, we start to realize how many people pretend to be blind and deaf in front of this problems. Thus we will do more to solve the issues and save the Earth.

I think it's very dangerous that the climate change deniers realize that they can gain traction by targeting children in schools. These children are most likely to take action or call for action for climate change. The way the book is written makes it sound credible and that can sway a lot of people, especially if someone picks up this book to further their belief on climate change denial. The point in trying to misinform the younger generation is so that once the current deniers are too old or die there will be a new face for it ready to deny climate change even as the effects come to show later. They realize that if they educate children in their schools they can plant the idea that climate change doesn't exist and it only makes it harder for people to become more informed.

Regardless of how the statement “97% of scientists agree that climate change is anthropogenic” was formed, it does not take a scientist to see that the planet is actually changing. Reading the publishing, “Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” it felt a bit much like propaganda in a way. It appeared to have a biased standpoint which was to discredit everything regarding climate change and how it is cause by humans. Reading it, it gave no evidence as to why scientists disagree but only mentioned how the finding of other publishers are not valid due to their techniques of obtaining the information. 
              <br><br>

I think that people in my generation are exposed to climate change so much to the point that reading articles like this sound completely stupid given that the climate can be seen changing on a day to day basis. From Australia burning to the melting of ice caps, it can be seen that humans have created unfavorable climate conditions. Even if the issue of climate change is not anthropogenic, the planet’s climate can be seen changing and we as a species should be doing something on the issue because of the detrimental effects that are to come. We know what can happen based on what scientists predict, so reading the article was a bit annoying because it creates doubt in people when really, we should not be arguing over the validity of climate change but arguing on how to solve the changing of the climate.

I agree with you very much that the existence and need for regulation of the artificial greenhouse effect do not require global warming as a necessary prerequisite. After the Industrial Revolution, the rapid development of the human economy, science, industry, and population led to a sharp rise in the use of fossil fuels, which emitted a large number of greenhouse gases that formed a sharp growth pattern, various unreasonable land use, air pollution, and various ecological issues. Destruction and other unsustainable developments are visible worldwide. The heat island effect is a good example of the imbalance of the carbon cycle. The problem of carbon dioxide emissions and greening in cities has caused an imbalance in the carbon cycle of urban ecosystems (local ecology), a serious greenhouse effect, and disruption of the fitness and comfort of our living environment Causes the above-mentioned pollution health problems. Environmental assessments and carbon emissions management within the city are decisive for our living environment. I think everyone has a deep feeling for the blue sky that does not play cards according to common sense. Reducing the greenhouse effect includes not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also rational urban planning, landless use, and greening vegetation, etc., and the scope is not just limited to climate and environmental science.


<br><hr>
I agree that reading “Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” felt like reading propaganda, but I thought to myself is that just because I have been exposed to so much more material that justifies why climate change is indeed real? Do people who are exposed to material produced by the likes of The Heartland Institute view material published by the IPCC and NASA as propaganda? The more I think about the climate change "debate", the more I realize it is centered around politics. The different perceptions that people have about certain sources alone can affect what they think about a topic. This is clearly evident regarding the climate crisis because although the statistics clearly show anthropogenic climate change is happening, many people in the United States ignore that climate change is happening because they discredit sources that don't fall in line with their political beliefs.

              <br><br>

I like that you mentioned that the human race has a duty to do something about climate change, regardless of whether or not it is anthropogenic. Even if someone doesn't believe that humans don't contribute to natural catastrophes or rising ocean levels, we need to exercise ways to combat these deadly phenomena that are wrecking our planet and the life on it. It is not too late to start making changes to fight the climate crisis, but not believing that the frequency of deadly is rising and that the Earth is warming is an opinion proven outdated and utterly incorrect.

<br><hr>
Yeah, exactly. I am wondering about the based data of that statement “97% scientists agree.” I don’t believe there has been any survey taken about this topic, saying exactly 97%. That’s impossible. I have read many articles talking about global warming in various reasons by scientists from different fields. 
              <br><br>
And I agree with you about your comments on the reading. This article did not give out any validated reasons or proofs but attack other scientists point with unnecessary information.

<br><hr>
I completely agree. We are able to see the climate crisis all around us, from the devastation and frequency of natural disasters increasing to the loss of biodiversity occurring at exponential rates. I also agree that reading this perspective was frustrating. The reading seemed hypocritical as it blamed scientific studies for not having basis while having no evidence to disprove their claims. It often cited its own source and claimed that politicians need to  “seek out advice from independent, non government organizations and scientists who are free of financial and political conflicts of interest” even  though they are funded by the fossil fuel industry. As someone who knows this information and reads between the lies, it's frustrating to see how convincing this could be to those who are unaware. I agree that this may be easy for our generation, who are receiving more environmental education through schooling and social media that the generations before us, but we need to be considerate to those who simply have never had the same privilege. The fossil fuel industry is playing off people's ignorance for their own profit, while the lives of future generations and the health of our planet and its ecosystems are at stake. This is a bleak picture, made only bleaker by the fact that it may be almost impossible to escape the lies the fossil fuel industry spews with their money. However, I agree that the only way out of this is to stop feeding doubt into the system and push for real action.

<br><hr>
I agree wholeheartedly with this comment. Although the article does a great job explaining its reasoning behind why climate change is a myth (for instance, the article mentions that the statement "97% of scientists agree that climate change is anthropogenic" does not necessarily demonstrate that climate change is in fact occurring. It uses the majority to convince other people that climate change is a problem and does not have any scientific backing) I believe that the authors of this book are missing the bigger picture. It feels like the authors are trying to discredit pro-climate change scientists and the work they have done instead of proving them wrong with other experiments. Like Imanol mentions, one issue I have with the reading is how the authors shoot down pro-climate change statements by claiming that these scientists performed faulty experiments which led to skewed results. To me, that's not explaining why scientists disagree on global warming like the title mentions, it's an ad hominem fallacy which exposes the author's biased writing.
              <br><br>


What really surprised me after the reading was seeing how many people left 5-star reviews on Amazon for the book. As I'm typing this comment, 59 percent of users gave 5-star reviews while only 15 percent of people left 1-star reviews. It amazes me that three-fifths of the people who read this book were left actually convinced that climate change is a hoax despite it having affected us for decades now. With the wildfire season now becoming year-round and the ice caps melting, I simply don't understand how anyone can deny that global warming is happening now.

              <br><br>

I think everything ties back to denial. I believe that even some skeptics have doubts about the validity of their thoughts on climate change. However, since the issue affects humanity indirectly, it becomes easier for people to deny that the problem is occurring rather than stressing about how to solve it.
<br><hr>

They worry about the life, occupation, or skills that they depend on, such as those in the oil industry, who worry that acknowledging climate change will threaten their jobs. The message shouldn't be a gloomy and hopeless scene, which makes people feel that individuals are powerless in a powerful climate change issue. It should be that climate change is serious, but people have the ability to take action to change the situation. Now is not the time to be pessimistic. We can change and start from now.

I find Ken’s point in this video regarding education’s role in the climate crisis to be of utmost importance. I have two younger siblings who are currently receiving the same education that I received throughout middle and high school. From my recollection, there was little discussion on the climate crisis, if any. While in high school, the administration of my school made an effort to push towards more sustainable practices and educating younger generations about what sustainable practices we could adopt in order to mitigate some of the effects that the climate crisis has brought about. The cafe at my middle/high school, Ross School in New York, adopted a sustainable approach to cooking for a large group of students who have quite picky dietary habits. Chefs on campus sourced fruit and vegetables when in season from local farmers, supporting the local farming community. One of the most important aspects of the dining experience at Ross came after you finished your meal. There is a small room near the exit of the cafe that is dedicated to composting and the separation of all elements of what remains from your meal. Composting has been a practice at Ross surely since before I began attending school there and it defiantly brings down the amount of food waste they generate as an academic institution—they even feed boarding students three meals a day.

The Heartland Institute’s campaign of misinformation is startling and very dangerous. The scope of the three hundred thousand copies of their book, having the power to mislead millions of youth, poses a major threat. While not every copy of the book will reach its full potential, any influence at all combats the possibility of progress towards the crisis we are in today. The use of the Unibomber by the Heartland Institute in an ad campaign is manipulative as for many, it hits home and will succeed in associating the climate crisis with a lack of sanity. While it is valuable to see both sides of the spectrum when it comes to the climate crisis, when one side is in such a minority it can be very misleading. This book, especially if you have little to no prior knowledge of the crisis, can be very persuasive that anthropogenic climate change plays a less significant role while natural causes have a bigger impact than we realize. However, it is important to understand that many of these articles and claims are being sponsored by the fossil fuel industry.

While reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I kept thinking about the warning Ken attached to the reading link. As I did the reading, I made an effort to be openminded to the information being provided. I think it is important to weigh both sides of an argument and then formulate your own conclusion. The text was truly made to be convincing, the argument was executed in a persuasive way. There was no confusing language and was an easy read. I think this aids in its persuasiveness in that it seems very informative. I can certainly see how people could be easily convinced climate change isn't real or as severe as others make it to be. The aim of the reading seems to be to raise confusion and provide a sense of security by making readers doubt. Information is so readily consumed today, that more often than not, a majority of it is misinformed. It can be very overwhelming for an average person who doesn't do extensive research; so often times people will latch onto quick facts they see or misinformed article titles that don't necessarily aim to inform but to be clickbait.

I saw in another comment on this video regarding propaganda targeted at teachers and it made an impact on me. Teachers are a crucial role in a children's growth. In school is where we learn about the world around us and the people around us. Teachers shape their students with the lessons they teach and these students grow up to inherit the world.

I completely agree with your response. The scary reality of "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,"  is how persuasive the text is and the fact it can easily appeal to the younger/ less educated population. Scientific research can often use academic jargon that can easily confuse the general audience, however this book steered away from the use of hard to understand statistics and vocabulary which heavily increased its credibility. In addition, the consistent references to the authors sources makes it seem as if there was an actual basis for their argument against the climate crisis, which as we know is false. I found it almost scary how power, in the form of monetary wealth and political stature, can produce this quality of work by reputable and evidently highly educated authors in the pursuit of deceiving the general public. Furthermore, in reference to the point you made in your comment, it is a bit overwhelming seeing as media has a great power to persuade the average reader who most of the times won't fact check where their information is coming from. This makes me wish that there was some sort of filtering in place to avoid the promotion of these detrimental mindsets in a way that wouldn't interfere with first amendment rights but still would give the reader a warning that the source may not be as credible as they lead on. 
              <br><br>

Now that I've addressed the issue with the mindset presented throughout the book, I'd like to simply touch on the personal reaction I had to the reading. Similar to you, I attempted to read the information with an open mind however I just ended up becoming frustrated because what I was reading contradicted with everything I knew about the climate crisis. One thing that really frustrated me was how they claimed the IPCC was "agenda driven" when in fact the corporations fighting against climate change are agenda driven ones. What do scientists gain from being right about climate change? Sustainable energy sources, healthy dietary options, an improved global transportation system, does any of this sound like a detriment to society? However on the flip side, what do large industries, such as the oil, coal, meat and fashion industries, gain from climate crisis being natural and not anthropogentic? They gain profit, in terms of billions and even trillions of dollars by not having to acknowledge the fact that their industries are killing the future of planet earth. That is what I found so frustrating about the reading is that we, as the human race, don't have time to sit around and debate about a scientific consensus or whether a study was agenda driven. WE NEED CHANGE. After a certain point, these debates need to not be political and should be made practical in terms of how and what is statistically factual versus theoretical. If the heartland organization doesn't agree with climate scientists then prove them wrong. Use this money that they are spending to manipulate readers, educators, and the general public to run trials, studies and experiments to get scientific, not opinionated, evidence against climate change. While doing these trials hire unbiased scientists who are educated enough to run the experiment but have no ties to the climate activism or climate denial, to avoid bias. However, as we know the outcome will show the truth: Climate change is real, and the situation is extremely dire.

"Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is different from what we used to read. Some writers want to proof that the scientists are wrong and discredit them. However, the writers have no evidence or studies to support their arguments. Almost all the climate deniers prefer to talk about the cases that disapprove the global warming. They never mention other more cases that support the global warming. The way that they just focused on the special cases and ignored normal ones is unconvincing. They gives out a lot of books to the teachers which leads to that students acquire wrong knowledge about the global warming. The education plays an important role in preventing global warming.

Something that I gained from reading this book is how much I don't know about scientific terms and the legitimacy of "studies" that come from different articles. When reading this book I learned that if I hadn't been taking this class already and or learned a bit of what climate change was, I would have so easily fallen into what this book was trying to portray. It made me realize that I usually don't think twice about believing what scientific or scholarly articles say, because I chose to trust in there reasoning and studies. From reading this book and seeing how nicely put together it was with breaking down all the claims and listing references for their findings , I noticed that I can't just trust any article no matter how professional and I have to really evaluate the contents of the reading and studies. 
              <br><br>

Since the very first page I noticed the diction was very science based and with a target audience of stem professionals, and as someone who is not  not in the stem field or know much about science in relations to this topic I found myself getting lost in all the listings of professionals and scientific terms being used to make it all seem true. Now, the fact that this reading was sent to science teachers from K-12 really demonstrates the intentions that the supporting personnel behind the book wanted to do. They wanted to instill their beliefs at the root of a new generation by sending there books that claim false to climate change to teachers so that they could then tell their students. Many teachers after reading this book might have fallen to trap that this book is. This book really did its best at trying to tear down any front that climate activists have by attacking any flaws that they may posses in their arguments. They did a really good job on that in their second chapter be trying to debunk all legitimacy of articles that propose that a great about of scientist agree on climate change and that human impact is a main cause. They were able to break down the sources that the promoters of that argument had and honestly really made myself as a reader question their credibility. This book just serves to prove that us as the general public and readers must be careful of pieces of work such as this, so that we don't fall prey to this false statements.

The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” tries to establish credibility by incorporating well-thought out scientific diction while citing numerous sources after each argument doubting anthropogenic climate change. I found this extremely ironic because after watching Ken’s video and lecture, I learned that an overwhelming majority of the cited sources are actually funded by the conservative organizations that work with the fossil fuel industry. By focusing on the quantity of sources, rather than the quality, the author almost discredits his own argument by proving that the work does indeed follow a political agenda, which is their main argument against the IPCC. The book attacks climate change in a number of ways, from stating that climate activists are trying to violate the right to freedom of speech to attempting to discredit the IPCC which is a huge governmental organization funded by the UN. However, one of the most memorable statements is that “Most prominent organizations supporting skepticism get little if any money from the fossil fuel industry” which is simply not true, as was stated by Ken in his video. Clearly, organizations such as the Heartland Institute are receiving large amounts of funding from the fossil fuel industry, while obviously following a political agenda. For example, the fossil fuel industry has directly targeted teachers and schools for supporting the true scientific consensus on climate change, and by sending copies of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” to schools across the United States for free. If that’s not pursuing a political agenda then I don’t know what is.

I find it astonishing how fossil fuel companies pay to make kids think that climate change isn't real. Targeting the future of our country seems to be as if they are taking extreme measures in order to make a profit. While climate change deniers only make up a very small portion of scientists, the backing from these big fossil fuel companies makes their impact larger. Ken also talked about how certain states were taking measures against climate change education which is even more astonishing. We should be focused on making sure there is a place for these kids to grow up in instead of trying to teach them false information and making them think our world isn't dying.

I found these chapters incredibly fascinating because most uninformed people who are actively looking for more knowledge on climate change are usually very trusting of articles written by supposed “scientists.” It is definitely more than a bit disconcerting to see that even those who are in agreement about the effects of climate change are using just the same deceiving tactics as those who don’t believe in it, simply to grow their follower count. 
              <br><br>

The people who consider themselves part of the climate change movement are seen very often on all sorts of media platforms preaching about how corrupt the opposing groups are and how they deceive so as to get people to doubt the truth of climate change. Yet, as learned in this article they themselves are not above exaggerating facts if it helps their agenda. 
              <br><br>

Oreskes’ was a prime example of how flawed the movement for stopping climate change also is. For someone who is not even an actual scientist, she is awfully confident about what she stated in all her literary pieces and it’s scary to see how easy it would be for an individual uneducated in the subject of climate change to be reeled in but not with actual trustworthy information, but rather with exaggerated facts meant to only add another misinformed person to this movement. This type of activism is not helping people believe in climate change in my opinion but actually hindering its validity in the eyes of others who know about other actual reliable information.

The book, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," sets up a very convincing contention which addresses the credibility of the atmosphere emergency. It has made the threat and seriousness of the atmosphere criss appear to be irrelevant. This sort of material was stunning to see in light of the fact that all through the quarter we have been given articles, narratives and youtube recordings identified with the realities and bedlam at present occurring from environmental change. 
              <br><br>

This is an ideal case of the past readings on the grounds that regardless of whether this age is taught about the main sources of environmental change, the most well-known issue is disavowal. This book presents disavowal to an outrageous degree; it has even made me question the verifiable information of other researcher however after watching Ken's subsequent video, I keep on having my solid sentiment about the atmosphere. It is disheartening to see that the petroleum derivative organizations have made such a controlling book to misguide people that the environmental change is assume to occur because of characteristic causes and yearly wash down. One of the fundamental worries that this book present is the possibility that 97% of researchers concur that anthropogenic environmental change is going on. Logical information demonstrates that human action is the main driving reason for environmental change. This is a worry since kids admire their parents and educators as direction and a good example. Our training framework is a piece of the desire for sparing our planet in light of the fact that the instructor will have the option to exhibit verifiable proof to the more up to date ages with the goal for them to become concerns and really make changes.

Watching this video left a bad taste in my mouth. First and foremost, I believe having differing perspectives and debating on issues is nothing but a facilitator for growth and furthering knowledge. However, when people use deceit to purposefully cause a divide caused by ignorance in order to propagate their agenda, then there is something wrong with that. This made me think about how we often tend to follow the group/masses when formulating an opinion,  but these mass opinions can be built on a foundation of false information as we see here. It is awful how minorities and those lacking formal education were targeted as they do not know any better, or have no way to fact check. The main problem also lies within the public who might know and understand the severity of the climate crisis, yet will continually act blindly towards it in an effort to retain a comfortable lifestyle, thus effectively diminishing the significance of the issue at hand. Nonetheless, it is simply shocking how much effort people will put into trivializing the climate crisis. Why? For capital? It's odd to me...

At a quick glance, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” looks legit. It has a cover, a dedication page, uses words like “Scientific Consensus,” and includes seemingly reliable references and graphs. Upon further investigation, you can clearly see how terribly unreliable the book is. Most of its references are from the Heartland Institute, which with a quick glance to the front or second to last page of the book, you learn that the Heartland Institute is the one who published the book on why the Earth isn’t warming. Seems kind of silly and weird to see a published book to reference itself, right? In addition, most of its bold statements aren’t backed up by actual evidence. As Ken presented in class, the quote, “yet such claims [that anthropogenic climate change is real]are either false or meaningless” isn’t backed up by any credible source.
              <br><br>

I would assume that the findings in the book were legit if I wasn’t skeptical to begin with. Like most things, I assume the information is legit and reliable because who would give out the wrong information, right? However, some people may not approach the material with doubts and may initially view the information as credible, especially if they didn’t take the time to refer to the references. This makes me worry for the people who do not know anything about climate change and view this seemingly convincing book.

I agree with your idea that this book may be convincing to people who read it blindly without prior education surrounding the climate crisis. We are very fortunate to be able to take this class which dives into the climate crisis so deeply, but the average citizen does not have this luxury. Many children may be taught about climate change in school, but I would assume it is very surface level. Therefore, when people are presented with this book, they might not be aware of its lack of credibility. The authors do a very great job of sculpting the book to look very legit with many sources and statistics. I think it is very scary that there is misleading information like this out there because I can truly see how someone could be convinced. If I were to have read this book before beginning this course, I would not have known that it is sponsored by organizations affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. While I might not have believed everything due to prior knowledge, I wouldn't have questioned the credibility of the source.

Similar to what you said, this reading made me worry for people who came across it without a solid belief in anthropogenic climate change. I know if I weren’t already a firm supporter of climate action, I would probably be convinced by this book. Additionally, it is especially concerning that the Heartland Institute pushed this book out to teachers and released it as a free pdf. I really hope that there are climate advocates pushing literature out to teachers as well.

I almost believe that global warming and climate change are a lie after reading the book. The book is really persuasive and convincing. It list a numerous of scientific data and high educated scientists to proves its authenticity and authoritative. Let’s not talk about its authenticity first. If this book is spread and believed around America, I believe most Americans will believe climate change is a fraud because people like me who know what is really happening have nearly believed in it. I am scared by the number of 10 million American children will be taught by this book. Education is the foundation of our future. If 10 million future Americans deem that human activities are not causing climate change, they will not take action to stop it and our planet might go to ruin.
              <br><br>


The fact that the fossil fuel corporative secretly let their think tanks to educate children that climate change is a fraud really irritate me. What they’re doing is tampering with the reality and truth. They are doing it simply because of their greedy for money and power. This is crime. They do not care about the future generation. They are telling the false thing and making the children to do the wrong choice. They do not care because when the time that catastrophic consequences happened, they will already be gone. What they are doing is absolutely irresponsible and despicable. I agree with Ken that we, the young generation, need to take action immediately and try to be in power to change the current circumstances. Otherwise we and our children will suffer a lot in the future.

The book is completely manipulative, and what shocked me the most was that it doesn’t even attempt to hide it; the very introduction of the book is completely aggressive and paints this very radical picture that no scientist agrees with the base concepts of global warming when that isn’t the case at all. I believe that a book written by people with an agenda isn’t knowledge, its just disguised propaganda. And the fact that they sent out thousands of copies out is extremely concerning since not everyone has the access to the information we are having access to. People will read the sources and think “seems reputable” and just accept the information as truth.

The reading, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" was presented with a warning about how the authors can be convincing. So, to approach it I had to let go of all the information I had learned about anthropogenic climate change for a moment and try not to be hardheaded about reading information I knew I would not initially agree with. As I dove into the reading,  I was surprised with myself and I caught myself understanding their viewpoint. In the Flawed Survey section, specifically with the Doran and Zimmerman case, the authors mention how their survey is deeply flawed because out of the 3,146 responses gathered roughly 1,000 did not have Ph.D's and some did not have a master's diploma. I can understand why the authors would put this information in their book because it hurts the credibility of the respondents and overall findings. While having a Ph.D and/or a master's diploma adds to one's credibility, it should not be used to discredit people and their opinions on a certain subject. In this case, the respondents were all earth scientists and that alone should validate their opinion and response on a survey about climate change because they have a foundation on what they are being asked about. In regards to Ken's video, it makes me angry learning that fossil fuel affiliates are targeting K-12 teachers who are devoted to educating the children of this country. The children are being affected by this and it is not right. They trust their teachers and if they begin learning about climate change skepticism early on, it might become difficult to make them believe the other side of the argument. It is alarming understanding if teachers begin educating the children on climate change skepticism almost 10 million children will become affected by it. Ultimately, affecting our world too making them hesitant to treat it better.

After reading the article "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," I was left feeling a bit frustrated because of its attempt to persuade readers that the climate change crisis is unreal. It was very alarming to hear that The Heartland Institute, which happens to be the largest climate-denying organization in the United States, mailed out 300,000 free copies of the book to K-12 teachers. Like Ken said in the video, education plays a crucial role in whether or not individuals believe in climate change. By sending those copies of the book to the teachers, students all around the country are taking in biased information which will forever be embedded in their minds. The institute's tactics to prey on adolescents is just one of many ways to mislead individuals from our generation and also protect the fossil fuel companies that fund their campaign.

I felt this exact same way and found myself confused on who I can really trust. When mailing out free copies of this book to be taught, it acted as a form of propaganda to be spread to young and impressionable kids. It made me wonder what other things may I have learned that were not completely true and just taught out of the greed and business for another person. Education should be a neutral place, just giving the kids knowledge to prepare them for the future. There should not be any special interest or sway. Teach what is true and have an individual stance just giving out the knowledge. The fossil fuel companies like this comment said are completely taking advantage of children and spreading false information to them without the children even knowing. Climate change is not something we learn in school, that's why I really wanted to take this class because it's a very unique opportunity. We get most of our information about this crisis through the news, but I wanted to sit down and really understand the extent, cause, and solutions to a great problem facing our world. And it's sad that kids are not getting this opportunity but are actually being taught the exact opposite.

Reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” was very sickening, to say the least. It blows my mind knowing that there are still many people who will deny global change and essentially target educators in hopes of spreading false information to a younger generation. This new generation is doing extraordinary things to try to slow down and fix what the older generation has done to our beloved planet Earth. The same people who are responsible for the majority of pollution now found on our planet earth are the same people who are writing books that are easily accessible and even sent out unsolicited to those who are now educating and raising the new generation, aka our planet’s last hope. The book was very manipulative and very unpersuasive, in my opinion. It tried denying unquestionable facts with little-to-no evidence to back it up. Most of their sources are not credible and their statements are very vague. The book mostly denied all the evidence of global warming, rather than presenting the readers with as much evidence as there is now about climate change being real. It is hard for me to wrap my mind around the idea that many people today will try to feed this generation a bunch of lies and hide the undeniable truth simply for their own personal gain. The authors of this book are funded by fossil fuel companies who are being greedy and opportunistic at the cost of the rapid death of our planet.

It is alarming how well organized the argument is in "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming". Upon further analysis, it is clear that the people who wrote the piece were looking for data that fit their narrative rather than analyzing the data itself. The use of strong words such as "debunking" shows the use of attacking language rather than presenting a counter argument in a professional manner.  The use of statistics is especially alarming as it is a case of them citing real statistics, but only using parts of the whole. Oftentimes, statistics are rather unreliable as it is possible to bend the way it is presented to push a narrative. By not including important facts regarding climate change, you could say that the authors are lying through omission.
              <br><br>


The point brought up about political ideology and the stance taken by scientists is an interesting argument. The author tries to convince the readers that scientists report information that only support their views, thus leading to bias. This is true; ironically, it is the scientists that are hired by big companies to do research to disprove climate change that provide great examples to this statement. This piece is alarming as an ignorant, uninformed, or literary inexperienced person may easily be convinced by the narrative as they cannot recognize the fallacies that are used.

I agree with your comment in that statistics can be pushed and bended to fit whatever narrative you create. Throughout the book the language used made me feel very skeptical on if I was really reading something based off of factual science. After watching Ken's video on the reading I was able to see how this book was supported by a conservative think tank which are also funded by fossil fuel companies, so that destroyed the credibility of the whole book for me. The book being widely spread and open for anyone to read is really concerning, as anyone can mistake the nonsense as facts.

As Martin Luther King Jr. said, "nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity." It is evident that both climate skeptics and the corporations behind them are aware of the climate crisis happening around them, but are instead choosing to actively deny this in order to continue fueling their greed. If not, there would be no need to spend exorbitant amounts of time and resources on "evidence" that fits their agenda.

“Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” was definitely a different reading from what we usually read. It was interesting to see how the writers were trying to discredit many scientists but never used other studies/proof to help their case. This continued on for the entire three chapters that were assigned and to be honest after a while it got boring and repetitive. However, they did manage to get my attention every time they would bring up a big fact and tried to discredit it. The most popular fact that we have grown up hearing about is “97% of scientists on...” anthropogenic climate change. They tried to discredit this fact by bringing to our attention that the way they calculated that percentage was not right. However they failed to show us how many scientists actually believe in anthropogenic climate change and their data and sources to prove this.
               <br><br>
In lecture Ken mentioned to notice how they claimed that over 50,000 books had been sold AND given out to the public. Skeptic teachers who use books like these in their classrooms are feeding future generations the wrong information. Young students are reading books like these and are easily being fed information that is not true. Although we may not see in the UCSB community many teachers are teaching their students that climate change is a hoax. For instance in high school my freshman Biology teacher taught our class that climate change was not real and that it was just another way for the government to take our money. One of my classmates from high school is currently taking this class with me and although we are lucky to have had the opportunity to attend college, many students that were in that class did not have the opportunity to have their minds changed about the topic of climate change.

You raise a good point about they fail to provide data on how many scientists believe in anthropogenic climate change, if it's not 97%, what do they think it is and how have they derived that figure? I also thought it was interesting that your biology teacher taught you that climate change was a hoax! The school that I attended did not really allow teachers to teach based purely on their opinions on certain issues. It’s so true that this can be so harmful, especially to the youth of our generation. When the youth aren’t being taught about the causes and consequences of climate change, they don’t have the knowledge to be able to debunk these teachings that are being taught to them by people who they trust and look up to. This is also why I found it very concerning when Professor Hiltner mentioned that certain states are trying to pass laws that makes it more difficult for kids to learn about the dangers of climate change. It keeps humanity stuck in this cycle where we don’t teach the younger generation to learn about mistakes made in the past and the intense consequences on the future, and then expect them to be the generation to implement changes and avert this crisis. Teachers play such an important role in shaping young minds, and knowing that some teachers are using their influence to promote that climate change is a hoax is very alarming. The education system needs to do better, and fast.

I found it very interesting that in Ken’s video, he explained how only 35-45% of school teachers agreed that 81-100% of scientists agreed on anthropogenic causes for climate change. It is really confusing to me how so many educators are not aware of the problems going on in our world and its even more so concerning because the education of the new generations’ children are in the care of these same deniers. However, Ken’s video really worked to show me how important the education of children, and even adults, can be.

This fact really came through for me when reading the book, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”. I had a self-realization while reading the book that had I not taken many classes, attended many lectures, and overall educated myself on the causes of climate change, I might have bought into what the book was selling. This book was expertly crafted to deceive its audience by basing its claims on “facts” and quoting seemingly credible sources. Only upon a deeper inspection of the book could one notice the opinionated wording, the many references from the Heartland Institution and Associates, and the lack of a true scientific backing to their arguments. It also made me somewhat fearful, because these same arguments are effectively swaying many people, even educators, based solely on the writers’ ability to craftily compose their propaganda.

I found Ken's video to be very alarming after realizing the lengths fossil fuel industries will go through to distract people from the climate crisis. To know that teachers are being taught to accept this form of thinking about denying how humans play a role in global warming is unbelievable. Education plays a big role in determining how future generations will act in a situation. Without knowledge of how humans are negatively impacting the atmosphere through the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, society as a whole will not act to try and solve the problem. The book, “Why Scientists disagree about global warming” was truly shocking to read. I found that the book tried to discredit many sources arguing for the negative impacts fossil fuels have on the climate mentioning that they are unreliable for not having real knowledge over the issue.  Frighteningly they were quite convincing in trying to convince the reader that the climate crisis issue is not man-made. The book's sources came from the fossil fuel industries which make their argument questionable. I think it is wrong for the fossil fuel industries to make false claims in regards to the climate crisis and have people believe such claims.

I agree with you that is surprising to see teachers are being taught to teach these theories to their students because teachers are very influential in the way students think especially at a young age. When I was younger I was highly influenced by what I was taught in school and I can only imagine what teaching young kids that climate change is not real could do to future generations. Also, it was written to be convincing so teachers would probably be convinced by what they read.  It is honestly quite unbelievable what I read from chapters 1-3 in " Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming"  because most of their argument was contradicting because they were saying that there is a bias, but the same can be said for political leaders and people who are being funded by these oil companies. The only reason they are skeptics is because they do not want to go against where they are getting a significant amount of money from.

After reading Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, my blood began to boil. When I read that K-12 teachers were forced to read propaganda and teach it to their students, I got extremely upset. These teachers are being targeted by big fossil fuel companies so that future generations don’t wake up and take them down. Unfornately for them, environmentally mindful activists are catching on and won’t allow this to happen. The best way to counter this is by properly educating our teachers to teach the youth the truth about climate change. 
               <br><br>
 If our children develop climate change denial, then we will be in big trouble because they are our only hope to seriously slow down the climate change crisis. Big fossil fuel companies know this so they are attempting to brainwash K-12 teachers so that children will be skeptical about global warming. 50,000 copies of this book were given out and they will continue to spread propaganda unless everyone is educated.

After reading just a small excerpt of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” I am concerned about what lies beyond those three chapters and even more concerned that it was sent to so many teachers. What is most worrisome about this book is that it is written to be completely convincing, it gives off the first appearance of being a well-researched argument. Throughout the piece there are clearly stated “references” that give readers a false sense of security. This is dangerous because the people who might not have any previous knowledge about the book, such as the children who the author was targeting, might actually be swayed and convinced by its compelling strategies. 

                <br><br>

In the foreword Marita Noon claims that “true science is never “settled,” and true scientists are always eager to ask and answer questions,” which in the right context is correct. Scientists may debate the effects of climate change and what different circumstances may arise but they are not debating whether or not climate change is happening, or whether or not humans are the cause, those are simply facts. This manufactured idea that there is still a debate is a tactic meant to protect the companies that are doing the most harm to our planet, but people without that knowledge may think that a debate sounds reasonable and justified. This also upsets me because if children are exposed to this thinking they will get a false sense of what science is actually about and may lose interest in a truly amazing field of education. 
                <br><br>


Something I found particularly disturbing was when Professor Hiltner pointed out that only 30% of middle school teachers and 45% of high school teachers knew the fact that 97% of all scientists are in agreement when it comes to anthropogenic climate change. This is terrifying because these are the people that are teaching the next generation. This is the generation that is going to be faced with the effects of climate change the hardest throughout their entire lifetime and they will go in blind and confused if the people educating them turn to false teachings. It is also just as dangerous that half of k-12 teachers don’t even teach the subject. Without exposure to the topic the children won’t even be able to challenge the thinking of climate deniers because they won’t have the basic knowledge to help them do so. I know that throughout my time in public school I was not taught about climate change, at least not in depth, but thankfully my parents exposed me to the topic and I have learned even more in college. 

                <br><br>

Something quite ironic was a statement made at the beginning of the second chapter which stated that, “Climate scientists, like all humans, can be biased. Origins of bias include careerism, grant-seeking, political views, and confirmation bias.” The author claims that there are climate scientists skewing data for personal gain while this entire book was created as “scientific proof” for large corporations to use when they are criticized for destroying the earth. There is no doubt that the people who wrote this book are connected to the Heartland Institute which is known for manufacturing data for corporations to deceive politicians as well as the general public. 

                <br><br>

Overall it is quite alarming that this book is so readily available to the public because it does have the potential to steer people in the wrong direction when they are looking to learn about climate change. While I was not convinced at all by this book it was due to me going in with previous knowledge of its illegitimacy and a strong stance on the climate crisis being a real, human-caused issue.

The fossil fuel industry’s efforts to muddy the water on climate change is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever. Is money more important to them then the world they’re leaving behind. Don’t these conservatives know that greed is a sin. Do they realize that they live on this earth. They are not separate from the environment so why are they setting it on fire. Many Native American communities  teach us that we are one with the environment which is true. We need to look to our Native American brothers and sisters and their outlook on the environment. The fossil fuel industry might not suffer like the rest of us because of their endless cash and power, they’ll certainly won’t be happy when we’re gone and their profits are gone.

This book was a boring slog to read, and it was horrendous the whole way through. Filled with inaccuracies, fluttering back and forth between topics... it was very insidious climate denial, masquerading as everything it was not. But the funniest part to me was its insistence that political ideology informed climate opinion... because, really, I'm almost positive that it's the opposite. Political ideology doesn't inform climate opinion: climate opinion informs political ideology. 
                <br><br>

If you are a skeptic, you are not going to be a Democrat: you'll become a conservative near-instantly. The opposite is true. Someone who believes in climate change-- unless they simply don't care about it-- could never align with republicans. I'd add more to this thought, but... it's really quite straightforward, isn't it? There's not much to debate and it's extremely straightforward. Of COURSE political ideology is going to matter when it's a life-or-death issue that impacts all of our ideologies.

This video in particular seemed to highlight the role that politics and personal intentions play in the global warming "debate". People have always acted by putting their own interests first and that's exactly what scientists during the 70s and 80s did. They saw the warning signs of permanent climate change early but due to their personal affiliations they had with certain cooperations and political powers they found a way to skew the evidence in their favor. Even almost fifty years later though groups continue to spread false interpretations of evidence and weak claims that the climate crisis isn't real. In 2017 the Heartland Institute sent out thousands of copies of a book denying human's role in climate change to schools all across the country. I find this extremely frustrating because the reason the climate crisis has escalated to the point it has was due to the years of denial and confusing people about the truth.

When listening to Ken’s video, I grew increasingly alarmed after hearing about the full extent of skepticism and confusion that surrounds the issue of climate change. Generally, kids spend fourteen years of their lives attending school five days a week, listening to the things that their teachers tell them. That’s countless of hours spent learning about a variety of topics and concepts, many of which are never needed again and eventually forgotten after the exam. Considering these countless hours children spend at school learning a great deal of things that are, in the long run one could argue, useless, what Ken opens the video by stating is all the more mind baffling: “More than half of K-12 teachers do not teach climate change at all. And those who do teach it only devote an hour or two to the issue.” Two hours out of the thousands of hours spent at school? How can anyone rationalize only spending two hours teaching them about what will probably be one of the most pressing and life changing problems, if not the most urgent issue, of their generation? And calling the way teachers are specifically targeted by companies like the Heartland Institute problematic is an understatement. In my opinion — morally and ethically — it’s a despicable tactic that is borderline criminal! When I heard about it, the first thing that came to mind was the propaganda in dictatorships. Instead of a dictator in America, we have the large corporations backing the fossil fuel industry for their own financial gain. Even though 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is real, I think the real challenge is convincing the general public who must in turn be moved to action and put pressure on political leaders, essentially leaving them with no choice but to do what needs to be done.    

                <br><br>

Reading the book was shocking. I was surprised at what great lengths were taken to present their arguments as factual and realistic. It was actually extremely easy to understand how someone reading this without a great deal of awareness on the truth of climate change could be taken in and believe what the book was presenting to be the truth (although I often did find their arguments to be trivial and weak). Suffice to say, my view on those who deny climate change simply because they don’t know any better has changed. Honestly, I wish books like this could be banned but in a country with America’s political landscape I don’t see that happening anytime soon. This is unfortunate because a large part of the problem with climate change is that the truth has been hidden for far too long and is still being hidden. It’s books like “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” that contribute to that ignorance and propagate the spreading of falsities.

The trouble with receiving conflicting information is that anything can be confirmed. If you look up something on the internet, someone somewhere will confirm your beliefs with opinions, “facts,” or other testimonials. This can be applied to opposite sides of an argument, such as the existence or hoax of climate change. I believe this is tied with the information that students are taught in school. Growing up, from elementary to high school, most things that were taught to me, I fully accepted as the truth with little question to the authenticity or truth within their message. It is true that I should have been more questioning of the information fed to me by doing research on my own time or giving deeper thought to what I accept as the truth. Nevertheless, what is taught in primary and secondary schools should be under veracious scrutiny because students should be able to trust in the accuracy of the education they are receiving. If teachers have the option to teach their opinion, students will never have the objective truth, since everyone has a bias, knowingly or not. For example, back in the early 1900s, teaching evolution was up for debate and a matter of the court. Luckily, science won out over a religious belief, specifically because it is a matter of science. 

                <br><br>

In the discussion of climate change, or any matter of particular importance, I urge people to do some more digging of their own. I am often guilty of just accepting what is spoon fed me in school without any scrutiny, which is a habit I wish to change. I know there is always more than one side, or aspect, of an issue or argument so I try to keep an open mind about who is telling me what. Despite this overall caution, the evidence and support is overwhelmingly in favor of climate change being largely human driven and causing physical and psychological damage to huge portions of people. I am fortunate to attend an established university at which I receive a wonderful education, and I have to remind myself of this privilege because billions of people do not have the opportunity to go to any sort of college, depriving them of tons of information. My wish is that the truth will win out and bring power to people to make a change.

After heeding Ken’s warnings about how the reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” attempts to sway its readers towards the opinion that scientists are confused about whether or not climate change is in motion, I tried to keep a neutral mindset as I dove in. Immediately I noticed how aggressive the tone of the reading was as it “exposed” or debunked certain data, and that was only the introduction! As I read on, I couldn’t help but imagine how easily this information could be consumed by masses who are not knowledgable on the topic of the climate crisis. Knowing that the author is basically targeting younger children whose curriculum does not include the severity of climate change is worrying.
                <br><br>

 The younger generations may grow up to become skeptical if these types of misleading media are readily available of them, and yet, at the same time, the younger generations are the ones who are supposed to be the hope of reversing some of the effects of climate change. How can we ensure that’ll happen if they are ill-informed by those who want to corrupt this movement we are working on?

I agree, the reading itself was very aggressive in "debunking" the climate crisis. However, like you said this reading could probably very easily convince someone who little to no knowledge about the climate crisis. What was very annoying throughout the reading was the way that their method of proving the climate crisis wasn't real was by arguing against basic facts. A simple google search would let someone know that "97 percent of scientists" do in fact agree that climate change is a dangerous situation for our planet. 

                <br><br>

As you said and as Professor Hiltner says in the video, the impact a false reading like this could have on the younger generations is profound. I wouldn't be surprised if this media was put out by the fossil fuel industry in order to influence young minds. As someone who wants to work with children in the future, I hope teachers also become more competent in teaching students facts and not exposing them to misleading media like this.


<br><hr>
This piece is just a microcosm of the actual doubt-casting techniques that are being used in large corporations and think tanks around the world. The book "Merchants of Doubt" by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway goes much deeper into this mass effort, but claiming that no scientific consensus has been reached on climate change is not only problematic, but untrue. In fact, scientists around the world have come to a nearly unanimous agreement that anthropogenic climate change is very real, and we're running out of time in stopping it.
                <br><br>


Think tanks and doubt-manufacturing entities (such as the Marshall Institute) take advantage of uninformed audiences in order to spread their propagandist views, yet they claim our efforts to save the planet are propagandist, and "radical." I'm not sure how long it will take for these individuals to recognize the gravity of the situation, but hopefully it won't take long.

<br><hr>

I agree that this reading would probably (and has probably) convince many people that do not have very much knowledge about climate change. It is very alarming to think that there are so many articles like this one and so many people like this author that are out in the world actively persuading people that the climate crisis is a hoax. I cannot wrap my head around the fact that there are people in the world that would manipulate young minds for their own benefit. I also find it very sad that so many of our educators are also unaware of the reality of the climate crisis. Like you mentioned, the younger generations will have a big impact on this crisis, and if they are only being taught about it through the media instead of their schools, then they could easily be learning very inaccurate information. I think that if we had an education system that teaches students about important issues such as this one, then our world would be a much better place.
<br><hr>
I thought that this approach was especially interesting because it was catered towards K-12 teachers, who are able to influence the masses. If somebody didn't know anything about climate crisis, they would be just as accepting of these facts as they were the actual ones. The problem with climate change is the fact that there are so many scientists that agree to varying degrees. There's not one single view on climate change, since some believe that there's no climate change at all, some believe there is but it's natural, and some believe that climate change is due to the actions of humans. In addition, this research is funded by various organizations that might make their findings biased. Because everything about climate change becomes so foggy, nobody is able to take a clear stance on it until it's too late. The younger generations, as Kaila stated, are going to have to discern between fact and fiction in order to coupe with the repercussions of their ancestors actions.

<br><hr>

I agree that this reading was carefully worded and intentionally constructed to "muddy the waters", even though we have not only reached an almost unanimous consensus but are also running out of time to salvage the situation. Although I try to keep an open mind when reading the material, I found it quite difficult to agree with its key arguments. Freedom of speech is important, of course, but it has a clear limit. Sometimes there are not two sides to a universal fact; if even the most fundamental perception of truth is a debated topic among the masses, how can we come to a powerful solution at all? If the uneducated and gullible are indoctrinated by climate-change-denying propaganda and continue their frivolous lifestyles, will it be too late when they finally recognize the disaster our humanity's headed for?
<br><hr>

I completely agree I believe that the reading constantly reiterates how there is "no consensus" on climate change, and kept a rather aggressive tone throughout the reading. The Heartland Institute is passionate about debunking arguments in favor of anthropogenic climate change, yet does not provide any of its own evidence for climate change being a completely natural occurrence. They appear to be a legitimate institution, which is rather alarming if this information were to appear in schools and misinform younger generations.

<br><hr>
I agree and think that it is a technique that many climate change deniers and big businesses use in order to push their own agendas.  They add a layer of doubt and confusion in the minds of the public so that nobody can get a clear stance on the issue and will continue to push it to the back of their minds.  What .is most shocking to me is that they would so deliberately target the people are in charge of educating the youth of America.  They know that if they get the doubt or skepticism into their minds early, it will be much easier to persuade them to their side in the future.  It will also not teach the kids how pressing of an issue it is and they will continue to be as ignorant or passive as the generation before us as our earth continues to be destroyed by our actions. 

                <br><br>

Companies like these are funded by big corporations who are trying to extract every last resource from the earth before the public catches on to what they are doing and finally does something to stop them.  The people need to do their research before they believe everything that they hear so that they can learn the truth about the problem from those who have the best interest of our world at heart.

<br><hr>
I think that it is especially worrisome that the reading is so organized and easy to understand. The chapters start out with the key findings, which are simplistic and seemingly obvious points like "climate scientists, like all humans, can be biased". Of course all humans innately have some bias and climate scientists are humans; however, their evidence from research have as little bias as possible. The younger generations could easily read these points and have these ideas planted in their minds because they seem like legitimate points and some of them are partially truthful but used to manipulate. 
                <br><br>

I completely agree that the way to solve this is by starting in the education system. First impressions are extremely important for young minds; if someone's first impression of the climate crisis is a book that falsely accuses scientists of having an agenda and using the climate crisis to make money, then these ideas very well might stick in that person's mind. Even when reading sources about how climate change is a real issue and there is irrefutable proof of that, someone may think that those sources are the ones that are false. Thus, it it imperative that we introduce the idea of the climate crisis to children from a young age, so that they can grow up knowing how to live sustainably and how to discern fact from fiction.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with you, Kaila. This book was written very well and seems to use evidence and sources that are reputable. It is very interesting (and somewhat appalling) to see how much misinformation could make the average person question even the hardest of facts. I like how Professor Hiltner even put a disclaimer at the end of the prompt saying that we should not be surprised if we are a little convinced. 
                <br><br>


I also agree with your point in how this is misinforming teachers across the country, due to the fact that the Heartland Institute sent a bunch of these books out. I would say that this is, at the very most, criminal and, at the very least, severely biased. 

                <br><br>

This is just one of the many hurdles that we as a people must overcome. To be able to convince climate change deniers will be one the greatest tasks we need to undertake if we are to take effective action on the crisis.

First of all, science is not perfect. Research can have flaws and limitations. That's why when more researchers find out the similar result, the result is more likely to be true. Because the scientific conclusion is based on repetition, that's why in science, "truth rests with the majority, not the minority." As a social science major, it's such a joke watching those people attacking these journal articles and papers just because they are not "perfect." I believe there must have thousands of studies on climate change. How could this denial of "consensus" be truthful when they only looked at those with many flaws. It's funnier when I read the author wrote that a signature that can be submitted by anyone in one-second could be used as a better example of a "convincing source" than a research paper that may cost years to write.
                <br><br>

I feel like the author is just trying to say that it is a very complex problem, that all the results and evidence pointing towards global warming is skeptical, which is possible, and I might have agreed. Yes, we may not know what we know because the universe is so big, and anything could happen. That's why we keep studying it and prepare for the worst outcomes, which seems to already and unfortunately occur. However, this book and the narratives are so provocative and inflammatory. Though the book points out that the researchers who believe in global warming are being biased, the authors are being biased themselves. They could have said: global warming could be real or not real, and that further evidence needs to be found. Instead, they literally just denied all the work and directed the audience to the exact opposite direction, which they have no valid and reliable "science with no flaws" to back them up. Anything they write down could backfire them.
                <br><br>

When the human-caused climate change is damaging our lives and planet, they are not the people who pay for the consequences, nor are they the people who really suffer from global warming. After reading the text, the authors and their supporters just appear as really bad people in my eyes.

The article was honestly pretty convincing if you have no prior knowledge of the climate crisis. It was well structured and easy to read. They provided many facts and cited everything that they said, making it seem like the message that they are trying to get across is correct. This is why they targeted schools and gave them free unsolicited copies. Children look to their teachers for reliable information, so if the teachers are given false information and share it with their students, the students wouldn’t know any better and take their teacher’s word for it. In the book, most of their argument was that there was not a “scientific consensus” and therefore we can’t prove that the climate crisis  is a result of human activities. This whole argument did not change my view on the situation because they argued that the 97% of climate scientists are only a few scientists who actually claim to be climate scientists. To me that doesn’t make too much of a difference. I would rely more on the information about the climate crisis from climate scientists rather than scientists who focus on a different area in science.

Of all the issues surrounding the climate crisis, I think this is easily the most frustrating and upsetting. The campaign of misinformation is perhaps the biggest impedance to solving climate issues. The worst part is that we know specifically that the information spread by conservative think tanks like the heartland institute and the Cato institute are entirely false! We have tracked down where the funding for these institutes come from and we know that they are spreading misinformation, yet we cannot stop it and allow these institutions to continuously put this information into the media. I think this should be illegal, regardless of a right to free speech. I think this kind of spread of false information falls into the category of yelling "fire" in a movie theater. It is dangerous, it is morally wrong, and after thinking about this for some time and reading Oreskes, Mackay, and Stoknes, I'd go as far as to say that it is evil!

Reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" was a very challenging task for me, because often when I read texts about arguments that I disagree with I enter with a very pessimistic, ready-to-argue attitude. This is obviously a very close-minded attitude to have,  but it helped me when conquering this text, specifically when I read the foreword and saw the author implying that President Barack Obama cared more about the climate crisis than ISIS, which /obviously/ is a bad thing.  The author's attitude, which unabashedly leaned very conservative, reminded me a lot of my own pessimistic flaw, and from that I was able to go into the book knowing that it was going to be very biased and most likely either intentionally misleading or wrong.
                <br><br>


One aspect of the article that specifically annoyed me was the author's implication that because not many scientists studied the various aspects of climate change, no one could be trusted, so therefore it's fake. It was quite the jump to conclusions. Like first of all, if we cannot believe scientists then who should we trust? Scientists follow the law of scientific integrity, so if anything it's foolish to assume that any of them would mislead the public. 
                <br><br>


The fact that this was forcibly sent to politicians, as well as K-12 schools, is honestly pretty frustrating. Their intention of misleading the younger generations is actually interesting because it contrasts with Ken's idea from last week's lecture, to properly educate the coming generations.

After reading “Why scientists disagree about global warming” and watching Ken’s lecture video, I feel really sad about the future generations since nearly half of them are now taught with wrong knowledge about the climate crisis. The fossil fuel companies influence those children by funding the book like the one I just read. It’s unbelievable to know that these companies are doing this to change children’s mind just for their own companies’ benefits. Also, children are very easy to be “educated”, and more significantly, they hardly change their knowledge in the future. 
                <br><br>
Another important factor is the teacher. When the teachers are not even sure about the reason of the climate change, how could they teach the new generations the right thing to do and the right way to think about it? The result is going to be the next generations will treat the environment worse and worse because they do not feel bad when they do it and this is what they were taught.

While reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" I understood why people are confused about global warming. The book is very well done and persuading. If I had little to no previous knowledge of the climate crisis I would inevitably believe what the NIPCC stated. They went very in depth in their arguments and backed it up with sources. The sources are very unreliable due to their alternative agenda in this issue, as Ken explained in the video. However if I was one of the teachers who was sent this book and had little interest in this subject I probably wouldn't look into the credibility of this book. 
                <br><br>

This book is very dangerous for those who don't want to believe the climate crisis is real. "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" appears to be credible allowing logical people, who are afraid of climate change, to feel validated in not believing in climate change. This could potentially be a very large percent of the population. The climate crisis is very frightening and when people learn more about the issue they may be scared into denial. When people allow fear to paralyze them, instead of motivation, they turn to anything that will validate their denial, such as this book.
                <br><br>

What impressed me the most about this book was its ability to discredit the consensus that 97% of climate scientists believe human action is resulting in global warming. This number has been widely publicized so that even those who aren't familiar with this issue have probably heard of this statistic. Therefore I was surprised when I found myself questioning whether or not the 97% statistic was credible or not. The book continues to use this strategy, questioning arguments that climate scientists have formed. 
                <br><br>

Overall this book was very frustrating to read because I disagree with every point the book made. However, I am glad I read it because it gives me insight into what climate deniers believe in and why people are still confused about climate change.

“Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” opened my eyes to a polar side of the spectrum, in discovering the idea that the climate change consensus could be much less solidified than one would think. The concept that natural causes could be significant players in the increase of CO2 emissions is something that strikes me as odd, but in the book, is painted as possible and real. Just the mere idea that climate activists are choosing noncredible supporting information would truly lose the trust of many’s understanding of the climate crisis. The article does say that “a frequent claim in the debate is that a “consensus” or even “overwhelming consensus” of scientists embrace the more alarming end of the spectrum of scientific projections of future climate change.”

                <br><br>

To me, the rebuttals made against anthropogenic climate change in the book is not a reliable source of information. With the book being encouraged to teachers via fossil fuel money discredits the information extremely and exhibits the manipulative nature of the book. This makes me frustrated and sad to know that there are climate deniers who spread nitpicky information like this to deceive crowds for their own benefit.

I completely agree that the funding behind "Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming" causes it to lose credibility. However, the book's credibility is not what concerned me the most. Learning how books like these are being pushed onto teachers of K-12 was. I find it unethical and immoral for these big-money, oil companies to target teachers and furthermore the youth of America, in order to spread a misinterpreted understanding of global warming. 
<br><br>
It is quite obvious to me that these oil companies are doing exactly what big tobacco did when it came under fire after science revealed that cigarettes are actually wildly unhealthy for people. In both cases, companies protect their profits through the spread of misinformation and while scientists get paid a lot of money to make claims for these companies, millions of people suffer the consequences.

I completely agree with you. This is one of the first times I have ever seen/heard the other side of the “climate debate”. After reading “Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” I was confused and thought to myself is there more to this than I had originally thought? But after watching “Merchants of Doubt” I was reassured and even looked back on the reading and how the first chapter was titled “No Consensus”. This perfectly correlates with the film and how climate change deniers just need to cast doubt to prevent change from happening. The statistic that 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real, man-made, and dangerous is an extremely compelling statistic, however, “Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” does a great job at casting doubt and making people believe that that statistic is over generalized and wrong. It blows my mind that people can sit there and write books about how climate change is a hoax and the scientists behind it are biased and motivated by other factors, but that’s exactly what most climate change deniers are, people motivated by big companies focused on money and making sure people still buy into their companies. It’s devastating to see how our world is so motivated by money when these decisions are killing our planet and eventually killing us. It is hard to wrap my head around the manipulative nature climate change deniers use to get their message across. It completely blows my mind that the Heartland Institute, a fossil fuel affiliate, mailed 300,000 unsolicited and free copies of the book to K-12 teachers across the US. Without the knowledge of the other side “Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” could be seen as logical and reasonable. However, it is just another form of brainwashing to help slow down change and promote big companies and their agendas.

After reading “Why Scientist disagree about global warming”, I was irritated and frustrated with all the false hope and information that this book has given.  While as I was reading, I was trying to keep an open mind and try to see another point of view of when it came to climate change, and I realized that someone who isn’t well aware of this issue could easily be persuaded into thinking that climate change isn’t an issue that needs to be concerned about. Even though the author was laying out a large amount of the statistics for the reader, it is easy to see that the statistics only tell half of the story, and any person who has any experience dealing with data knows that it is not a good idea to draw conclusions from only pieces of the entire thing, and normally when people do that the date they put out there usually biased and unreliable. And it’s honestly sad that large oil companies will fund this propaganda, just so that way they can continue doing damage to the earth. It’s also disappointing that k-12 students are being taught false information about the climate change and will now grow up thinking it’s nothing to worry about, but at the rate the earth is going are they even going to have a chance to grow up.

I felt the same thing. I already had a bad first impression on the book but I still took the time to change my mindset and have an open mind in reading the book. Guess what? I failed. When I began reading this book, I thought that this exists to make excuses for our perpetual exploitation of Earth’s resources- formulated propaganda; the professional publishing, radical claims of inclusion, portrayed to be reliable data and references. “Fundamental uncertainties arise from insufficient observational evidence, disagreements over how to interpret data, and how to set the parameters of models.” This disagreement is nonsense. What was the goal for this book? Present the other side’s argument? There is no reason to do that. The scientists that stay believing that they are not contributors to the unprecedented spike in our temperature for the past 250 years are too smart for their own good. We know simple facts like the characteristics of GHGs. We also know facts about how much GHGs, especially CO2 in the atmosphere. There is so much data of the already existing effects of climate change. We have irrevocable facts and them trying to work around that and bend it to their bias is a waste of energy. Even if their true to some extent about the extent of our fault in this phenomenon, we still have a responsibility to delay the extreme effects of climate change. We can’t hide from the effects of climate change, including all the fancy scientists in their secured neighborhoods. However, books like this delay the goal of the brightest minds in the Anthropocene era: to use their imaginations, and create radical solutions to delay the maximized effects because of the generational split in climate change.

Seeing that the public school system in America is extremely underfunded, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that school districts are taking free materials to use in the classroom (even if they oppose the general consensus of scientists in America). Additionally, companies and corporations with anti-climate-friendly agendas can also sponsor these financially-struggling schools, influencing them to once again teach material that may be scientifically inaccurate. This book claims that scientifically-backed documents and films are propaganda (pg 39), yet (ironically) are spreading dangerous misinformation in a propagandistic way. I agree with you that it is frustrating to see greedy adults jeopardizing both the future of the planet and the education of children that have no say in what is happening.  

<br><br>

On another note, I think that this book would be a great teaching point about being able to differentiate falsified information from true, scientific data. In other words, reasonable skepticism. For example, students could identify the not-so-subtle opinions that the author has written, or the contradicting evidence (see pg 42, attacking the so-called use of gray-sources while using the same type of sources for the book itself). etc.

Reading the book "Why scientists disagree About global Warming" reminded me so vividly of an article I read about "The Climate Denial Machine." This article talks about how the Fossil Fuel industry has engendered a climate of doubt and uncertainty around the Climate Crisis. It begins by talking about how cigarette companies launched massive misinformation campaigns against scientists who were disparaging the use of cigarettes, despite knowing the truth behind the dangers of tobacco and cigarette use. The same thing is essentially happening here where Fossil Fuel companies are attempting to shroud the truth behind the dangers of the fossil fuel industry and so they launch campaigns, pay politicians and in general do whatever they can to stir up as much doubt as possible towards the climate change as possible. The company Heartland has been known for being one of the major influencers in Climate denial. In fact, there was a leak that exposed apparently one of their ways in which they attempt to keep the notion of climate change denial apparent: "The scheme includes spending $100,000 for spreading the message in K-12 schools that "the topic of climate change is controversial and uncertain - two key points that are effective at dissuading teachers from teaching science"". This is an extremely dangerous and significant method that could affect the climate change movement in the long run. This is because, as we saw the way in which we are going to save this planet is through the current generation, and the best way to inform them about the dangers of climate change is through education. However, if a stigma of uncertainty surrounds the notion of climate change from an early age then it'll be substantially more difficult then if we are able to educate students about the harms of climate change from a young age, and engrave passion in them towards the subject.

Before I began reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I made a mental note to myself to keep my existing biases from interfering with my interpretation of the book. I tried to keep an open mind and make a decision after the information had been completely presented to me, After reading it as well as the website and Ken’s introduction though, I saw just how flawed the Heartland Institute’s argument was. Although they did provide some valid points, such as people might use climate change as a method to achieving political power or pushing their agenda even though they didn’t personally believe it, and that bias is present even among climate change scientists, the valid points stopped there. Rather than debunk climate change “myths” and offer intelligent input of their own to concretely prove climate change was not real, they simply attacked current findings in an attempt to invalidate them. 
                <br><br>


Throughout the entire reading, they failed to provide concrete statistics proving the 97 percent consensus wrong. This isn’t to say they did not use statistics, but a lot of their findings were inaccurate. The writers know that they do not have to be accurate though, because they know the probability of K-12 students researching the validity of their claims on their own is very unlikely to happen. I believe this book is simply a way for climate change skeptics to push their views upon children who are easily influenced by their surroundings and what they learn in the classroom. 
                <br><br>


All in all, I can see why this book has been largely influential in creating climate change skeptics to this point. It is extremely well written and from a teenager’s, or even an adult with no prior knowledge of the subject, point of view, it is easy to see why they can be influenced by this text. In my opinion, climate change should be mandatorily taught to educators first who can come to their own consensus (hopefully on the side of real climate change) and then taught to students. It was astonishing to me that as much as 70% of teachers fail to teach their students any substantial amount of climate change. Corporate interests have impacted and controlled this planet for far too long, and this book is nothing other than them making a politically charged argument to secure their interests. If this issue is to ever be addressed in the future, it starts with making sure the youth are properly equipped and knowledgeable enough to combat climate change when their time comes.

The book, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” establishes a quite compelling argument which questions the authenticity of the climate crisis. Ultimately, it has made the danger and severity of the climate criss seem unimportant. This type of material was shocking to view because throughout the quarter we have been presented with articles, documentaries and youtube videos related to the facts and chaos currently happening from climate change. This is a perfect example of the previous readings because  even if this generation is educated about the leading causes of climate change, the most common problem is denial. This book presents denial to an extreme extent; it has even made me question the factual data of other scientist but after watching Ken’s follow up video, I continue to have my strong opinion about the climate. It is crazy to know that this corrupt, economically focused and opinionated argument is being presented to new generations of our communities, particularly in school environment, because the youth are the individuals who are suppose to be enlightened and motivated to make positive changes to our environment. More than 300,000 copies of this book were sent out to the K-12 school communities. It is saddening to observe that the fossil fuel companies have created such a manipulating book to misinform individuals that the climate change is suppose to happen due to natural causes and yearly cleanse. One of the main concerns that this book present is the idea that 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is happening. Scientific data proves that human activity is the number one leading cause of climate change. It does not help that most of our older generations are more likely to be deniers because those are the ages of our parents and teachers. This is a concern because children look up to their parents and teachers as guidance and a role model. Our education system is part of the hope of saving our planet because the teacher will be able to present factual evidence to the newer generations in order for them to become concerns and actually make changes.

After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I admittedly seemed to genuinely question the severity of the climate crisis. Halfway through the reading, I began to think, “Shit. So climate change isn’t as real as I thought it was?” This book truly is scary in the sense that it shows you how misinformation and the spread of false scientific data can still have major implications on the public opinion of the climate crisis debate. The book does, however, bring up a few good points worth noting. Just like in any debate, it is always important to also take a look at the opposing side. The fact that the 97% consensus statistic was so readily used and advertised, to me, weakens the argument for climate change. It is dangerous to over-report a scientific consensus and say that many are saying one thing when in fact, they are not. It is, however, hard to discern which of the facts mentioned in the book are true and which are placed to further an agenda for the skeptics and fossil fuel industry. 
                <br><br>


However, after watching Ken’s follow up video on the matter, I am further conflicted about what’s true and what isn’t. It’s easy to say that the book was indirectly funded by the fossil fuel industry, but what if the book has a valid point? If this book is also looking to deceive the public and misinform them with more data and research, then one thing is clear–climate change has become so highly politicized that I have to be extra cautious when trusting the “facts” and “research” presented, regardless of who says it. This is why it is important to always remain skeptical of every study on climate change and not believe everything that rushes to conclude the worst-case scenario in the climate crisis. By seeking the truth for ourselves, we are limiting the false information that is being allowed to plague the public and form this false sense of “group think”. I am not saying that all information about climate change is false news, but with books that bring up good counter-arguments and its own fallacies, we can never be too careful. Take this book for example. 300,000 copies were given to educators K-12 throughout the country–many of which will go on to be taught in the curriculum regarding climate change. One can see how this is potentially a grave mistake. By miseducating the youth of today, we are instilling a lesson into them that will shape the attitudes and the future course of action that will or will not be taken in regards to climate change. It is important to be educating the next generation and the current generation the right things and giving them sound evidence so that they can form their own opinions on the matter and do what they must with the information given. In the next lecture, I would like for professor Ken to address my confusion and clear up the facts in regard to the climate crisis debate. 

                <br><br>

Quite honestly, I find all of this frustrating and disheartening in trying to figure out the truth behind climate change and global warming. I wish politicians would steer away from personal gain and investment in fossil fuels, and give an honest effort in trying to either clear the debate or join the conversation in how we as a society can stop the rapid advancement of climate change. However, I have little faith in the current political powers who constantly let their personal agendas cloud their judgment for the greater good.

This reading had me cringing at points throughout it because of the inaccuracy that is depicted throughout it. Once again we are presented with troubling information on the climate change topic and ongoing fight to bring people together over it. I think this reading is sent out not only to cause doubt to people who do not understand the extent of climate change, but to reaffirm those who already do not believe in climate change. This makes it harder to talk to people about because those who's beliefs are reaffirmed go on to teach their kids, friends, or family why they believe what they do using this book as evidence. It scares me to think that adults want to subtlety attack kids on this topic because of how much they want to use their greed of gaining money through fossil fuels to further themselves while destroying the rest of the world at the same time. Hiltner was not wrong when he said that I would question myself based on some of the information that was presented in the reading. The only thing it made me really do was question how we are going about dealing with climate change. What truly is the best way to deal with it? We have to make sure that those who will be most affected by laws preventing climate change have ways to benefit them at the cost of convinces or how poorer people can still save money if heavy taxes were to be imposed on large carbon footprint items like cars. The book throws scientific words into it just to seem more official, which is dumb as it sounds can be useful on those who do not understand science deeply.

Never have I ever laughed so much at a written piece before. Though, I must admittedly say that “Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” is generally well-structured and well-written. However, that doesn’t make me overlook the fact that the authors of this book are very much hypocritical and ignorant. 
                <br><br>

First of all, I find it interesting that the authors of this book would claim that leaders of the climate change movement support the Clean Power Plan only because “it will give them more power, more control, and more profit” (xiii). How on Earth are professors, students and teenagers such as Ken and Great Thunberg expected to make a profit just by supporting renewable energy? After all, they are in fact leaders of the climate change movement. 
                <br><br>

Furthermore, the authors go as far as to attack widely-accepted facts that have been proven to be true and state that they are nothing but opinions with insufficient evidence. They claim that they have debunked said facts while they themselves provide little to no evidence that their claim is correct. While the authors do supply the sources from which they have gathered their information, there remains a lack of statistical support. In addition to this, they also mention that bias is a confounding variable in experiments that support the existence of anthropogenic climate change. For example, in page forty-nine it is said that financial incentives derail the credibility of scientific conclusions because they have thus enabled scientists to emphasize worst-case scenarios rather than reduce public concern. I find it incredibly hypocritical that the authors would claim that financial incentives rig the outcomes of experiments when they are most likely being funded by conservative organizations or corporations themselves. 
                <br><br>

Climate change is real and has evidently already impacted a good portion of the world. There is sufficient evidence to prove its existence and people should not be allowed to tamper with it or cherry pick certain aspects of it. Spreading the wrong information about the climate crisis wouldn’t benefit anyone in the long run if we are all dead. It’s time to open our eyes.

My reaction to the written piece is similar to yours. Despite it being well structured, I feel like I was just reading a bunch of fluff. I was not convinced by what they were trying to push. I found it very ironic when they mentioned biases that may come into play like you mentioned with the financial incentives. If anyone has biases due to financial gains it is those who play the puppet for big oil corporations and deny climate change. I may be wrong but I feel like more money is offered by higher ups to deny climate change rather than to fight for it. I cannot see this changing anytime soon. Climate change will continue to be a partisan issue and those on the denial side will be doing so to protect their own interests. The evidence is so clear. 10-15 years ago both Democrats and Republicans acknowledged that climate change was an issue. Since then, agendas have gotten in the way of facts.
<br><hr>

I had the same reaction as you after reading this book. I agree with you in that the book is well-written, and that's what makes it so dangerous. The people behind this are obviously very smart and know exactly what they are doing. I also find it terribly ironic that the authors claim that the leaders of the climate change movement support the Clean Power Plan because it will give them more power, control, and profit. Leaders of the climate change movement support plans like these because they care about the wellbeing of the planet, which can't be said for organizations like the Heartland Institute. Organizations like those are the ones who are money and power hungry, they're trying to push their agendas to maximize their own profits. 
                <br><br>

I also found it funny how the authors tried to debunk facts that have mountains of evidence behind it with no proper evidence. Looking past their cleverly placed citations, nothing the book states holds any substance. The authors cleverly picked and choose quotes from different sources that fit their narrative. Climate change is very real, and that is apparent looking at the current state of our planet. We don't have time to be spreading misinformation. We have already done the irreversible to the planet, the least we can do is take responsibility for our actions and actually do something about it.

This reading denies97% of scientists agree climate change is caused mainly by human activity. Scientists fail to find consensus on supporting this claim, but it is hard to find consensus at the same time. According to Ken, education can play a crucial role on climate crisis. People without specific knowledge may not be able to realize what can cause a huge difference on climate change, but if more people are educated enough, more people can realize it and give some clues to people around them. With only a small part of people, this climate crisis is hard to modify. If scientists can find consensus on climate change, there might be more people becoming aware of the seriousness of climate crisis.

The fact that this book begins with the blatant criticism of Obama and his administration is concerning. This book is established as a political opinion piece right off the bat and then continues to try and pass off as a collection of scientific work. It uses rhetoric that especially appeals to the emotions and morals of the readers. It is contradictory when the author discusses "true science" and how it is never settled. While this may be true, scientists reach consensus until new information is discovered. The author is saying that since there may be an existence of new information, none of the theories reached by scientists should hold any weight. However, this is just not how science works. They also align the Clean Power Plan and other green initiatives with increased government control and takeover. This book comes off as manipulative political propaganda.

I have heard about the denial of climate change since high school so it really doesn’t strike me that much when I read “Why Scientist Disagree about Global Warming”. The debate on the anthropogenic global climate crisis has been brought about a long time ago, though the ultimate purposes of this debate serve primarily to delay the economic loss of the fossil fuel industry. Admittedly I had sourced information from both sides of the debate and had a hard time to form a decisive view on the subject of the anthropogenic global climate crisis. So I do understand how important it is for such a global-scale crisis to be taught to students and kids especially. However, as Kent mentioned in the video, “the educators and the kids are the real intended targets of the conservative side.” It is sad to know that legislators of states like Virginia actually passed laws to deter student’s exposure to information that favors the alarmist’s side.
                <br><br>


But this book “Why Scientist Disagree about Global warming” is essentially a flawed argument against the “97% consensus”. For a prominent part, the article is trying to disprove that not 97% of scientists agree upon the anthropogenic climate crisis. Claims concerning flawed scientific methods and the so-called “political intentions” behind all the effort that approve anthropogenic climate crisis are made along with many “quotes” that seem to add credibility to the argument. However, the “scientists” who edited this publication are essentially the people who are creating these data and evidence. So it is actually a self-revolving argument that contains evidence provided by only a few who is inline with the argument itself. This to me makes no sense since the sources and evidences all come from a small group of people who have the same intention, regardless of the “scientificness” of this publication.

In “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” by Idso, Carter and Singer, the main purpose is to persuade the public that the Climate Crisis isn’t real or a man made issue. The authors poke fun at climate crisis campaigners for change and believe that legal action or reform is necessary. They believe that this will only destroy millions of jobs and cause rampant poverty because renewable resources of power are expensive. They try and make the claim that scientists are not in consensus about the climate issue in order to break down their credibility. However, the fact is that most of their so called “facts” are actually small fragments of data taken out of context and then manipulate to fit conservative’s agendas. They state that they “seek out advice from independent, nongovernmental organizations and scientists who are free of financial and political conflicts of interest” but the truth is the opposite. The same people who wrote this book and their experts (politicians and such) who offer “evidence” are basically con men who are bought out by gas and oil companies. The fact that this book is distributed widely between political offices and classrooms in extremely concerning. 30% of teachers from K-12 who teach about climate change believe that to some extent the climate crisis is from natural causes while 50% of teachers devote an hour or less teaching about the climate crisis at all. Teachers are divided because they are targeted by right wing organizations who’s best interests lie in the fossil fuel industries. By targeting educators they know that they would also be influencing the future generations. The truth is that the data and science that is given by thousands of qualified scientists do not equate the words of conservative politicians, businessen and bought out “scientists.”

At this point I feel like I am just repeating what everyone else is saying, but perhaps it bears repeating:
                <br><br>

 It is absolutely disgusting to target young children and brainwash them. Unfortunately, it is also the smartest, and probably the  most effective way to achieve their goals. It is also deeply saddening to know that there are teachers who read the book, and then decided to teach it to their impressionable students. I can’t completely blame them, because as everyone has said, it is a convincing book. But nonetheless, I would hope that if the teachers were not already climate change deniers, then they would not have been so easily swayed. 
                <br><br>

Thinking about the book on it’s own, and how it can be so convincing, I think it is important to look at Noon’s bio. She is the “executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc. and its companion educational organization, the Citizens’ Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).” Just from reading this, if you know nothing past the names, it seems like this person would have the earth’s best interest at heart. The next thing about her is that she is a columnist for Breitbart… Anyone who works for Breitbart should never be trusted. It is racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, and more, disguised as journalism. It goes so far beyond just being biased or right-winged.

It scares me that all you need is money in this country and you can distribute all the harmful lies, deception, and bigotry you want.

Before doing the reading, "Why Scientists Disagree on Climate change", I never truly understood how so many doubters of climate change were so confident with their claim. This scientific journal gave very convincing arguments that were backed up with data and seemed to be a reliable source.  Some of the points made complete sense to me as a believer of climate change so I can easily see how those who already were unsure on climate change would be convinced with articles such as these. There were many good points made (if true) such as how information like how 97% of scientists believe in human caused climate change are supposedly false. Another strong method used was quoting famous scientists such as Albert Einstein, that just one experiment can prove the majority of people wrong, which makes it seem like Albert Einstein would have supported them. Some of their points however contained fundamental flaws in it that can be easily described as hypocritical. Many arguments point to flaws in human characteristics that would lead to flawed survey results, experiments, and published work which could be true ,but then scientists against climate change would be just as susceptible to those flaws.    
                <br><br>
These among countless other incorrect statements such as how consequences from climate change have not been confirmed to hurt humans are straight up false but I am sure many people would not believe scientists with PHDs would give them false information.  Oil companies and their lobbies disappoint me in this sense because their misinformation already are hurting people and animals around the world. That is why I am a strong supporter of having a uniform acceptance of the reality of climate change by world leaders. We should not have to waste energy and resources convincing people of the problem when we should be fixing it.

It’s crazy to think about how far conservatives (oil associated ) will go in order keep climate change and it’s dangers in covers just to keep the flow of money coming in. They distribute anti-climate change propaganda to kids because they are the ones who are going to run the future and it’s up to the conservative think tanks to keep them on the same mindset toward a old fashioned fossil fuel ran world.
                <br><br>
If the kids start to realize the truth behind climate change that’d mean the end of fossil fuel companies in the future.

After reading and watching Ken's introduction video, I was annoyed that people think climate change is being caused naturally and not by anthropogenic actions.  Yes, there is natural climate change but there is a huge impact from anthropogenic actions that amplify climate change by a significant amount that it is ignorant to believe that people are not causing climate change but nature is.  What was also annoying is that people think carbon dioxide is not dangerous to the climate because it is natural that we breathe it in and plants produce it.  This does not mean it is not bad for the world if there is a lot of this gas in the atmosphere.  The atmosphere is made up of gases.  The earth is absorbing heat from the sun and the earth projects the heat back into the atmosphere.  However, before the radiation can get to the atmosphere it has to go through a gaseous layer before the atmosphere.  Those gases trap some of the radiation inside the earth's climate and if there is a build-up of these gases then a lot more of the radiation will be trapped and not released back into the atmosphere causing the earth to warm up.

<p>
It is not surprising that education could play an important role in climate crisis, so the climate crisis deniers also realize this.  A lot of teachers taught that the climate crisis is caused by the nature, and more importantly a lot of teachers ever don’t teach climate change at all. One reason is that part of teachers themselves does not clear about the facts of the climate crisis. They often cannot answer correctly.  Why there are so many teachers are not quite sure about the truth of the climate crisis? The book, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, provides information to deny the climate crisis. But the reason behind this  is that they are supported by a lot of profit-oriented fossil fuel companies. It is biased. We should learn more facts and information before believe what they said.

While this article is dense and seemingly riddled with good evidence to support their claims, I cannot help but question everything they say. The fact that virtually everything they are saying is an attempt to refute the belief that climate change is a real and serious issue is pretty alarming. It is difficult to trust someone who gives almost no credence to the claims of scientists studying climate change, and that essentially claims that scientists are biased. And that when in need of funding, they intentionally worry Congress and private funders so that way they can gain their favor. How malicious do they think scientists are? I do think every scientist has a moral obligation to present their findings as best they can, giving as much evidence as they can muster, and when someone disagrees and can prove them wrong, they accept this and keep working on their findings. I find it very hard to believe that scientists would so easily try to manipulate their findings or present it in such an embellished manner in order to influence people into supporting them. I’m sure there are some out there that do this, but not to the extent this book seems to claim. 
                <br><br>
The book also claims that scientists have fundamental uncertainties that arise due to “insufficient observational evidence”. Are dying and bleached coral reefs, massive migrations, dense air pollution you can clearly see, and extreme natural disasters not enough tangible and clear evidence? If not, then what is to them? While we may not understand exactly how every facet of the environment interacts, it should be clear that something is wrong, and climate change seems to be the most likely cause. We do not have the luxury of waiting until every scientist is in consensus with one another. We are very obviously exploiting and damaging the environment for our own gain, and the resources we gain from it are finite. There is no excuse to not change our ways. Our consumption and greed is out of control, and we should want to fix that from a moral standpoint even if the environment was totally fine.

I find it so ironic that the book starts off by introducing the NIPCC as not being politically motivated or agenda driven and attack the IPCC, but literally one page later in the foreword they start criticizing President Obama. To even further the irony, they mention how people who speak out against climate change fear for their lives and fear being attacked, but countless climate change deniers do that to actual climate scientists ? ? ? The ironic "non-political" rhetoric is consistently shown throughout the book. Particularly in how they introduced Naomi Oreskes as a "socialist historian"--it really was not necessary to refer to her as "socialist." Anyways, those were just some initial thoughts. I found that as I read the book I had to keep telling myself that this was bullcrap because sometimes the way they presented the argument made sense. The thing is, that's exactly the intention of the book. They present the argument clearly, citing their references and nitpicking at all the science. It's obviously all fabricated and dumb, but I can see why someone who doesn't know a lot of the climate crisis may be swayed by the book. They frame scientists as ambitious, politically-motivated people who are just trying to advance their careers. Moreover, they point out that climate scientists can be biased but can't they (the deniers) be too? The book was rather disinteresting to me just because I knew a lot of it was fabricated. I also think it's absolutely despicable that the Heartland Institute would send the book UNSOLICITED to thousands of k-12 teachers--their need for wealth, profit, and continuation of the status quo is absolutely repugnant. They are okay with interfering with the education of thousands of young kids and create skepticism in them just so the corporations who are at fault can continue with business as usual.

As Ken suggested in lecture, I researched the reviewers listed in the first few pages of "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change." Here is a selection of the most interesting ones:

                <br><br>

Roger Helman, UK government official: claims victim's fault in situations of "date rape"; claims homophobia is a "propaganda device" and that LGBTQ+ people do not suffer from systemic or personal discrimination. 
                <br><br>

E. Calvin Beisner, leader of the Cornwall Alliance: claims to be a Christian environmentalist. Denies existence of climate change, calling it an "obsession", claims science is "anti-Christian".
                <br><br>
 From his website: "The Arctic and Antarctic sea ice volume has never been higher in the last 11,700 years (except during the Little Ice Age of the 16th and 17th centuries), there is no dangerous rise in sea-level. Polar bears are healthy, global agricultural outputs are at their highest levels, and there are no signs of global temperatures rising to levels we have not witnessed in the past 2000 years." 
                <br><br>

(War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. I'll be right back, just have to move Orwell's 1984 to my nonfiction shelf.
)
                <br><br>

Dr. Judith A. Curry, PhD in geophysical sciences, honorary PhD in Kool-Aid guzzling: Handpicked one of the 3% of scientists who don't understand the facts around climate change. Stated in 2019 that she "won't bother" with peer-reviewed scientific journals to avoid the interference of the "establishment." 
                <br><br>

Despite those...interesting endorsers, we venture forward bravely. Noon, the author of the Foreword, is a contributor to Breitbart, which is the Neo-Nazi news site. Apparently, 300,000 copies of this book were distributed in 2017, which, contrary to what Ken stated in the 01/24 lecture, is a wild success: the point of propaganda is to be spread as far as possible, to policymakers, to educators, to children. The most influential, and dare I say, important groups in society; alter their viewpoints and in a year the nation will be radically different.
                <br><br>

Eventually, readers hit the full name for the NIPCC; I think this is a ridiculously persuasive title for a group, because we, as a society, have learned to despise and fear bias; calling something "Nongovernmental" just soothes the hearts of Americans, us plucky little jingoistic revolutionaries who hate and love our government in equal measures. Even without a scientific background, we know that "peer-reviewed" = good, and "no agenda" = good. So to claim that the book is supported by a panel of non-biased scientists producing a large body of peer-reviewed findings, well, who cares what the actual findings are when they're produced by a panel like THAT?
                <br><br>

I also find citing research from the Heartland Institute to be unbearably funny. If I wrote and turned in an essay where every source was credited "Just trust me, I know this" I would fail the class. The most dangerous part of misinformation is that most people, college educated or not, do not care to be on guard about where their facts are coming from.
                <br><br>

When suggesting that scientists are "herding" or experiencing cognitive dissonance when admitting that we lack complete data on climate change but still know that climate change is happening (p. 22) is obnoxious, to say the least. The biosphere is such a complex, multifaceted, and long-lived being that having complete data on a phenomenon that is accelerating rapidly is really hard to do. The models created may not be wholly confidence inducing by themselves, but when a lot of similar models, experiments, and observations point to the same thing (our climate is changing rapidly due to anthropogenic emissions), well, most scientists would indeed have confidence in coming to a single conclusion.
                <br><br>

This transitions well into the next portion of the text, Part 2, which claims that specialization prevents us, as a society, from having a comprehensive body of research on climate change. This is wrong. To put it simply, a thousand academics who each produce one well-constructed scientific paper creates a more comprehensive body of knowledge than one academic putting out a thousand bad ideas. There is a reason why the assembly line revolutionized industry: one person doing one task tends to get really good at it over time. Specialization allows us to study topics deeper than we could otherwise.

More specific to this video, there is a severe lack of K-12 teachers who have a rigorous, well-rounded science education, which is why we have people believing well-written pseudoscience books. National standards surrounding science curriculum are wildly laughable; only 20 U.S. states have adopted NGSS for science curriculum, and 24 states developed their own "based on" the recommended standards (source: National Science Teaching Association). This allows for a large variability in the uniformity and rigor of K-12 science education. Simply put, our societies and our planet cannot tolerate more generations with a shoddy basic science education, especially "education" based on propaganda from the fossil fuel industries. The way political agendas seep into a supposedly non-biased education system that is meant to teach children hard facts is horrific; these are the people who are growing up to become the next stewards of this planet. We are betraying them by treating their playgrounds as places for indoctrination into worldviews that are literally paid for by Big Oil.

I have never felt so astonished by a book that is providing the wrong information, and I have also never felt bad read a book. This book exploits rhetorical devices with excellence and is able to convince the reader, such as myself, with certain arguments. There were many times where I almost believed that climate change might not be as bad, but reality often brings me back. To be honest, when Professor Hiltner said that around 97% of scientists believe in climate change, it was mildly surprising to me, I thought that a large numbers of “scientists” are paid by the government to spread false information, but I seems like the severity of reality had to bring these people to the right side. The fact that the publishers gave around 300,000 copies of this book away is a very bold and costly move, even though they say that by “brainwashing” these children at a young age could be effective for their future goals, but I am not sure if they had ever considered the increasing occurrence of natural disasters that are happening right outside our doorstep. I have always wondered what climate change deniers often think, are they actually blinded by the false reality or is it just the money that corporations give them incentivizes them to tell lies.

Reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, allowed me to form a better understanding of how disagreements over the validity of the man made climate crisis take their origin from, as well as how these debates often bring scientists on both sides father away from realizing and agreeing upon one truth. We often find it amusing and almost unbelievable as to how climate crisis deniers come to promote their ideas, as well as how the “hoax” narrative can permeate so many aspects of these professionals’ lives (politicians, scientists, etc.). This article often had many convincing points and critiques regarding those (groups, organizations, and individuals) on the opposite end of the spectrum from within the environmental/climate science community. 
                 <br><br>
For example, the article’s discussion regarding “Climategate”, (the release of emails exchanged by prominent climate scientists discussing efforts to exclude global warming skeptics from journals, punish editors who allowed skeptics’ articles to appear, stonewall requests for original data, manipulate data, and rush into publication articles refuting or attempting to discredit scientists who disagree with the IPCC's findings, 49), allowed me to recognize how both sides of the issue actively try and suppress the critics and skeptics of the otherside. Scandals and behavior that deliberately tries to suppress the opinions and work of those from the opposing side only makes the situation worse, weakens any and all appeal, and moves both sides farther away from reaching any sort of goal, understanding, and the direct action (political) that we need. Another very upsetting part of the article included dialogue and quotes from alarmists (also professional educators) like Mike Hulme and Stephen Schneider, “So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have”, along with the promotion of “myths”. 
                <br><br>
 Even though the expressed purpose of the article’s free distribution is to facilitate and promote skeptical learning, I disagree with the distribution of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” to K-12 teachers around the United States. I believed in the truth about climate change before I read this article, and I continue to believe in it. But it is scary to think that this article and narrative was placed in the hands of arguably the most influential figures to our younger generations, teachers.

The reading assignment mentions about how jobs in the fossil fuels industries will be lost, affect the economy. However, it's clear that when we switch into renewable energy, more jobs for renewable energy will be created. Moreover, even though the readings has credible sources from NASA, like professor Hiltner said that doesn't mean the quote from NASA supports their thesis, it was "97 percent of scientist agree that climate change is both manmade and dangerous ." In fact this statement contradicts the thesis, but it does look credible in the citation. Sneaky?!

Reading the article Why Scientist Disagree About Climate Change really astonished me. The author really targeted many sources and I suppose debunked them. This is exactly why people become deniers, if I were to read this before I knew what I know right now I would also become skeptical about the climate crisis. It is hard to argue with the counter argument, but the whole time reading this I just thought about what I know. Like the rising ocean levels, the corals dying, and many animals going extinct.  How can you deny climate change being a serious issue when we see these effects on the Earth. Even if it isn't 97% of scientist that agree on climate change we still know that something isn't right and something must be done about this issue.

I 100% believe that climate change is happening right now. After reading “Why scientists disagree about Global Warming” I still believe that climate change is real and occurring. The article was well written, and I can see how someone can be greatly influenced if they do not have a stance on climate change. This book was sent out to teachers from K to 12, there are teachers who even themselves do not have a stance on climate change. This book is very misleading and will confuse students. Not only are they being given wrong information, but it is unfair. Fossil fuel companies who support this book are taking advantage of young children and know that they are greatly influenced by their teachers/adults. The goal of this book was to confuse people and distort them form what is really happening. I know that for some it may have worked and that is something that really worries me.

I agree with your statement, “someone can be greatly influenced if they do not have a stance on climate change.” I think that was the whole purpose of this book, to target people who could be persuaded. The book purposely misconstrued information in favor of the fossil fuel industries, claiming climate change to not be anthropogenic. Their tactic of sending the book to public school teachers was rather malicious because they knew they would be able to convince people who were unaware of the subject. I find it rather disgusting and disturbing the level of power an organization can have on our education system. I also find similarity between this and the debate over the information that is within public school history textbooks. There has been great controversy over the information within history textbooks, explicitly in the way they have been guilty of removing or altering certain parts of history to glorify America and Christopher Columbus. It’s troubling when information is purposely misconstrued to favor against what is actual fact. Denying the existence of climate change deliberately goes against scientific fact and scientific consensus. It is frustrating and terrifying that private industries can manage to manipulate the education system and try to corrupt the mind of the youth for their personal economic and political gain.

After watching this video, we need to acknowledge the fact how k-12 education changed over time. Not many know this, but one of the big changes in academic teachings were influenced by John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and Cornelius Vanderbilt. They changed the course information taught throughout early education to today's standards. One may ask, What importance does this have? The fact that these huge money influences shaped academic teachings early on is part of the reason why people today have such little knowledge climate change. How does this impact today's knowledge of knowing? With these men from the past making up half the countries economy at the time they were alive; no one questioned what they were doing. They became rich and powerful by investing in resources that would later directly impact climate change. These men changed the teachings at the time from learning about sustainability, foods that could help cure illnesses and other things like this to the core fundamentals that are taught in school today, such as math and English. These men, had so much money and power that when the threat of Nikola Tesla's ideas arrived they shut down his work and made him go bankrupt while he was amongst the search for new sources for energy. 
                 <br><br>
This is one of the reasons why K-12 education is so confused about climate change. This, and people just simply need to know the facts that are hard to find, luckily the reading brought up some of those facts.

After reading the article “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I start to doubt about what I think the “Authority”. I used to think that every book published is the authority, but I am confused now. Is the book published representing the authority? In the article, it shows that some authors of articles have no expertise in certain field and use biased data because they received benefits from private sectors. Since most of the publics are confused in certain question, they will easily accept the first information. Just like the white paper receive an ink point that are hard to erase. However, since some books have bias and can not be authority, they will misguide thousands of readers. Is the climate crisis real? I used to think it is 100 percent true, but now I am not so sure, since the truth is meaningless in front of self-benefit. However, according to what I observed from my surrounding, the climate crisis seems real. I hope those writers take their responsibility to present the truth, at least don’t misguide.

When reading a book that is filled with scientific jargon and appears well-researched, it is definitely hard to tell whether or not it is factual.  Someone uneducated on the matter of climate change, could easily accept everything in this book as facts.  As I read the first 3 chapters, I imagined myself in the mindset of someone like that.  The statistics and the references help the text appear scientific.  However, many of the sources and statistics are obviously cherry picked, or just wrong.  The book is intentionally misleading.  For example, in chapter 2, they constantly talk about bias, and how scientists that believe in climate change are biased due to their own careers or politicians.  What new readers don’t know is that the publishers of this book are in fact supported by fossil fuel companies.  I hope that people that read this book are smart enough to do any additional research on the subject, as much of the book will quickly be proven to be wrong.

This article denied the claim that “97 percent of scientists agree” that climate change is man-made and dangerous by stating that we fail to find a consensus in support of the claim, we must resolve those scientific disagreements first before arguing on the hypothesis of man-made global warming. It mentions that besides insufficient observational evidence, bias is one of the reasons for disagreement among scientists on climate change. I agree with Ken that education can play a crucial rule in the climate crisis. The example Ken gave in his video about people’s division of opinions on whether greenhouse gas CO2 is a contributing factor to climate change really impressed me: we breathe it out, plants breathe it in, they call it pollution, we call it life.

I am very happy that in California we still have a basic understanding of climate crisis. But, in the article, I also couldn't believe that people are denying that global warming is real. How can you deny scientists that know about climate change. It just does not make any sense. The only reason why these scientists and people deny it because it was just conflict with there profits.

Climate change should no longer be taught or debated as a two-sided argument. It is extremely irresponsible not to teach the youth about climate change. It is frightening to me to know that this book,  Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, was given out to schools and teachers and policymakers. Personally, it was difficult to get through the reading because I know that all of their supposed facts are just false. It was painful to read while knowing that uneducated people who read this are very likely to see it as legitimate. A topic that I have been discussing in one of my other classes is that falsities such as autism caused by vaccines, or that climate change is a myth, are often spread in text or videos that are easy to digest. This book is a perfect example, as it does not include a bunch of big scientific words or confusing graphs, rather the language is relatively simple and each chapter starts with a short summary with small easy to read statistics. In comparison to a detailed, factual scientific report, the book is much easier to read. This is extremely dangerous to the general populace. To an everyday person who might have limited science knowledge, a book of this nature might be more compelling to read and believe.  One of the most important aspects of science is communication. Without comprehensible and understandable communication from the scientific community about the realities of the climate crisis, the climate change deniers will continue to gain a following.

Education is a topic that is very important to me. Education opens so many opportunities for people to do good, and it hurts me to see it used as a political weapon instead. Throughout my years as a student, I have always taken the lessons taught by my teachers as true. I mean, what basis would I have to question what they teach me? As a student, your teacher is the expert. That is why it scares me so much that organizations like the NIPCC use the tactic of miseducating children. If my high school science teacher told me that climate change is not real, I wouldn’t have questioned them and went on to my next class. It would not have occurred to me to ask where they got that information and even less what funded that information. Luckily, that didn’t happen to me and I am now taking this class and able to learn more about the problem that I know to be true. But say that did happen to me. Say that my teacher told a class of 30 students, including me, that anthropogenic climate change is not real. Roughly 20 other students and I (70%) would go to college and probably learn that climate change is happening and that it is human caused, but 9 students (30%) would not go to college and would continue to believe that climate change is a myth. That is a large percent of the US population! I think that everyone should have the right to accurate education and it pains me that corporations are trying to exploit education in the name of saving their businesses.

Watching "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" makes me feel the importance of education risen to a higher level. According to Ken, if a K-12 teacher teaches climate change denial to on average 30 children, there would be as many as 10 million American children. It is horrible if those children become teachers in the future and teach climate change denial to their students, the number of people who support climate change denial would increase even more. Another thing I feel worried about is that people would even lie to themselves in order to ensure their future profits. I believe some of those leaders of fossil fuel industries do believe that the global climate change is caused by human activities, but they just can't agree with that.

I completely agree with you in that it is horrific that these teachers are informing their young students that human-caused climate change is not a thing. I am not at all surprised by the tactics these think tanks use in order to convince the general public, as well as the future generations of Americans that anthropogenic global warming is nonexistent. I am disgusted that these fossil fuel companies are funding “informational” books such as these. From the big industry point of view, it makes total sense to put forth these books into classrooms across the country, as it would delay the time it takes until it becomes illegal to extract fossil fuels from the ground. I also think some of the big cooperation higher-ups are aware of the damage being done to the earth but are not willing to give up profit. If extracting fossil fuels does become illegal, these companies will obviously not profit, and as a country, we would be able to transition from a fossil fuel economy to a renewable energy-based economy. Both are profitable, but the later will allow us, along with the rest of the living beings on Earth, to thrive here much longer. It is also up to the school districts to realize what kind of information they are providing to their children. It is time they step up and do some research themselves. I appreciate the fact that Ken makes his website along with his videos open to the public. I think, and hope, that his site will become very popular in the next year.

After reading this book, I began to understand why such an outrageously over-published book of lies had made such a shocking impact on the scientific community. Page after page, the book throws fact after fact and statistic after statistic at you in the form of counterpoints and conversation topics. At first glance, the book's use of data made it seem easy to read, comprehend and follow along, but upon closer inspection, I realized that even though I knew that statistics were being used, I didn't actually understand why these statistics were significant. Sure  31,748 climate scientists have signed a petition in opposition to the consensus on global warming, but what does that mean in contrast to the hundreds of thousands of climate scientists who do believe in climate change? 
                 <br><br>

If anything, "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change" does a fantastic job of confusing and sewing seeds of doubt into the minds of its readers. If I had read this book outside the context of this class, I may have felt inclined to believe some of the information that was presented to me. In addition so its lengthy conjecture, the book presents page after page of misinformation at you. I did a poor job of reading the instructions for this assignment and ended up reading the book in its entirety. What I found out after getting around 90 pages in was how mentally exhausting it was to process all this information. I was not used to reading extensive research reports, and I bet the thousands of other people who have read this book were not used to it either. 
                 <br><br>

I thought this book was a dangerous read. It can lead the uneducated down a winding path of false scientific claims and dangerous opinions. I believe that publications should be released that combat books like these and the institutions that publish and sponsor them. If done correctly, we can slow and maybe stop the contagious spread of misinformation.

After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I found that it is easy to believe that climate change is a hoax if that person was not too educated on the subject. This book provides many data and statistics in order to make this book more convincing. The authors are spreading misinformation to the public and in k-12 schools.
                 <br><br>
In this book, the authors talk about what scientists have no consensus toward the problem of climate change. They also talk about why scientists disagree with climate change was man-made and dangerous. This whole article provides many opinions that were completely the opposite of what we’ve learned before. 
                 <br><br>
In Chapter 2, the author lists the reason why scientists disagree with climate change is man-made. First, climate is an interdisciplinary subject requiring insights from many fields. Very few scholars have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines. Second, fundamental uncertainties arise from insufficient observational evidence, disagreements over how to interpret data, and how to set the parameters of models. Thirdly, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, created to find and disseminate research finding a human impact on global climate, is not a credible source. It is agenda-driven, a political rather than scientific body, and some allege it is corrupt. Also, Climate scientists, like all humans, can be biased. Origins of bias include careerism, grant-seeking, political views, and confirmation bias.
                 <br><br>
They make this book seems logical and scholarly. They use the data and report from specialists. This makes people who were not too educated believe them and think climate change was propaganda. 
                 <br><br>
All in all, this will become a serious problem. But most people in our generation are well-educated, and we will hold the power in the future. I think it’s hard for our generation to get mislead from articles like this. We should be optimistic to do something to change our future.

I also agree with you that if people were not too educated on the topic of climate change and if there weren't as many advocates, many would not believe it to be true. The book does use a lot of statistics that seemed convincing at first glance. I had to look at several statistics a few times because they were confusing to read. This book uses logic and facts, as the professor has stated that climate change deniers also find education of central importance. Essentially, anything can present itself as true with enough of reliable scientists and facts. Therefore, science may be subjective as some of its data and findings may be fueled by prior opinion, as we had already seen in the book. The data seemed quite convincing and I was able to see how scientific manipulation is powerful, as the data found in the book would have seemed more convincing to me if I had not already known the information I knew about climate change.
                 <br><br>

The distribution of information to the public is very influential in public consciousness, which is why wealth plays a large factor in climate change denial; false information is able to spread out. It is scary that this publication was so widespread, as over 50,000 copies were given or sold to elected officials, and in its second edition, over 300,000 copies were sent to teachers. The dedication to disinformation is not something that is new, as it is evident in other cases.
                 <br><br>

So aside from climate change, another issue that stirs up fear for me would be the way that scientific manipulation works in denying the issue itself. I believe if this book were sent to every person on the planet, there would be way more climate change deniers. Essentially, the science would not matter, but rather the belief that one holds. This is why climate change denial is a thing in the first place; people can still hold opinions outside of what is consistent with science and what is actually occurring. I think along with the data we are given, we should carefully look at bias, such as who is releasing the data and possible ulterior motives. For example, this book was published by a fossil fuel affiliate. Therefore, aside from data, we also have to consider other things, since as I mentioned before, misinformation can be spread to self interest. Climate change activists should do their best to tackle the spread of misinformation aside from climate change itself because it is ultimately up to the people to address climate change, and if they don't believe in it, nothing will be done.

In the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” the authors do a shockingly good job at pushing their views onto their audience.  They make their audience believe that climate change is not as serious as many “alarmists” lead us to believe.  They do this by writing in a very calm, cool, and collected manner in contrast to climate alarmists.  The authors want to come off more sophisticated in order to persuade their audience on their viewpoint.  It is definitely concerning reading something like this knowing that many people without the proper background knowledge will eat up this information immediately.  This is the perfect book to read if you’re looking for a reason to not believe in climate change, or you’re looking for something to make yourself feel less bad about not doing anything about climate change. Both not good things.  They’re giving the audience what seem like logical reasons to start being a skeptic on the epidemic, also not good.  Us, as college students taking a course giving us the proper knowledge on what is REALLY happening with climate change, must take action and be the voice speaking out against these forms of propaganda.

I feel the same way after reading this text. I can imagine how easy it would be for an impressionable child to just believe whatever is in this text book without having access to any other informational sources and going the rest of their lives believing that there is no real threat when it comes to the climate crisis. I feel for the teachers who also probably didn't know what to believe after reading the contents of this book. As grateful as I am to possess the knowledge I have about the true nature of climate change, I am almost fearful knowing that I will have to take on the role of educator and tell not only the younger children in my family but also the adults who may be brainwashed by the idea that the climate crisis is a hoax. I hope that texts like these stop being published so that we can fully acknowledge that climate change is a real issue caused by our selfish actions and we need to change our ways in order to have any hope for a future on this earth.


<br><hr>
I disagree that the tone of the book is as calm, cool, and collected as you have said. While they try to pose "alarmists" as unreasonable, illogical, and emotional, I also think the book fails in its own professionalism to prove their claims. For example, when the book goes over different studies that have been used to support the 97% claim, the author refers to the "...wacky Australian blogger named John Cook" (7). I find this language unprofessional and blatantly slanted, so it's strange to me that people could be so easily swayed by such obvious methods of propaganda. 
                 <br><br>
In the same vein, the authors insist that surveys (used to support the 97% claim) don't interview enough types of scientists, their own information about their sample size on their surveys seems to be shady as well. With the Global Warming Petition Project, the book cites that many signers had PhDs, but fails to mention what their PhDs are mostly concentrated in. I find it so frustrating that they delegitimize so many studies when their own sources are rife with biases and statistical errors as well. Furthermore, I wonder what specific audiences (especially if there were any that were not conservative or already looking for info to confirm their own bias) were swayed from climate change acceptance to denial by this book, because I feel that anyone who is a critical reader will be able to draw the conclusion that this is an incredibly slanted source.
<br><hr>
The book, Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, published by affiliates of the Heartland Institute is the perfect piece to persuade audiences uneducated on the unedited, unbiased, overarching data surrounding heightened temperatures, rising sea levels, and increase in extreme weather events that constitute the climate crisis. As college students in this course, we’ve been exposed to a multitude of perspectives on this issue from leading scientific news outlets to other students’ own anecdotes from wildfires in their own hometowns. Although, if the only source of information on the climate crisis you had exposure to was from this book, doubt in its anti-climate change agenda would be far less likely. School children, for example, were among the target audience for this text. It’s unlikely that a grade-schooler would doubt their own teacher(s)’ justification for why or why not the climate crisis was real because that’s their main source of scientific information. An appeal to vulnerable audiences by distributing the book to groups such as k12 teachers was just one clever tactics utilized by the Heartland Institute for spreading climate change denial. 
                 <br><br>
Personally, one of my biggest takeaways from this book was to be more skeptical, not of the climate crisis, but of informational media. Assessing the statistical data, authors, and context of a source can provide insight as to its legitimacy. For instance, the study by Doran and Zimmerman featured in the book which stated that ‘97% of scientists agree on anthropogenic climate change’ excessively focused on climate scientists is an outrageous argument to debunk the climate crisis altogether.  Ultimately, the delegitimization of climate scientists and selective use of data and opinionated arguments did little to assert the credibility of the source and only led me to question how it can seriously be regarded as an authoritative piece on whether or not the climate crisis is occurring.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you said that “the authors do a shockingly good job at pushing their views onto their audience.” That is something that I felt slightly frustrated towards after professor Hiltner said that this book from the Heartland Institute was marketing their climate-denying book towards teachers of young kids. It is upsetting that a fossil fuel funded company like Heartland can so good at deceiving many people about something that affects everyone’s life around the world in the name of greed and gaining a profit. The whole book was written in a way that anyone can understand so young children and other people will have access to this and be convinced that the work of fiction seemed to be true. Something also frustrating is that even though 97 percent of climate scientists agree that the climate is changing and everyone on Earth will experience the catastrophic events in the future, people from the Heartland or Cato institute they still have the power to refute this and many people will rally behind them. I also agree with you when you called this book “propaganda” because that is essentially what it is. They are using fear and doubt to try and convince that factual evidence is “not true” and even though 97% believe the climate crisis is real and should be dealt with, they are wrong while the average Joe is right and only they should be trusted. People in my generation needs to use the factual evidence we have in a different way so we can change the tides and make legislation that with help towards the climate crisis.

After reading the article, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, It definitely peaks my interest to read and analyze the other side of perspective regarding climate change. Before reading the article, I always thought that I am well-educated and well-informed in the issue about climate change. I have always criticized the “other side” of the argument, specifically, the leaders and some of the well-educated, scientists, politicians, and environmentalists on opposing that climate change is not real. I never get to actually understand their point until I read the text. Provided that, I was actually quite sold to the phrase that “97% of scientists agree or claim… that climate change is real”. I understand the capitalism purpose behind it and why editors and authors were able to argue that phrase in different contexts. However, I find it alarming that most of these articles and claims are sponsored by well-known think-tanks of fossil fuels. I realize that even though they are trying to clarify a point that climate change is biased, there is irony within the text itself.

Personally,  I believe that the think-tanks are supporting these kinds of articles to combat the authenticity of Climate Change and of course, to continually preserve their abundance in wealth, literally anything for profit.  Notably, there are drawbacks in the text that remain questionable. The text  mentions that the phrase of “97% of scientists….” to be some sort of over exaggeration is alarming and to conclude that the real number is actually around 79% instead of 97% already defeats the purpose of the whole text. Overall, I was quite entertained by the claims of the article because of the lack of consensus and authoritative claims that studies provide. The only question I ask myself after reading the article was, “Does it really matter”, I ask this question not to attack the intent of the article to question the authenticity of the issue, but rather, I question the people, the scholars, the activists, scientists, and the leaders throughout the world about why are they questioning the existence of climate change when we are already experiencing it? I find it alarming that humanity would rather argue and have a debate about whether climate change is real or not despite tragedies happening all over the world caused by climate change. The issues and effects are currently already in play, and that we just tend to blindly look at the situation, due to the sad reality, that there is more money involved in arguing or hiding the real issue than taking real actions in solving the climate crisis. When are we going to learn our lesson? When it's too late?

In Ken’s video lecture, he mentioned a television commercial by a competitive enterprise institute argued that CO2 is not a contributing factor to climate change but that “it is essential to life. We breathe it out; plants breathe it in. They call it pollution; we call it life.” I felt that this claim is worded interestingly, but it reflects a sense of not being responsible for the various and severe impacts human activities have on the environment. For sure, this claim might be true when industrialization has not begun, when human has not been exploiting natural resources unlimitedly, when there is harmony between human and the environment, but what human has really been doing to the environment has already exceeded the level of impact described in that claim. I feel like if there is a ruler with scales marking different extent of human impact on the environment, this claim is signifying that we are at the midst of the scale, but the reality is that we are nearly at the rightmost end of the scale. That claim implies an equal and harmonious relationship between human and the nature, but honestly, are we really treating the nature with “equal rights”, or are we exploiting it with barely any care and harmony? 
                  <br><br>

Reading the book makes me have similar feelings as reading that claim since they are all trying to shirk humans’ responsibility for climate change. I also admit that the book is worded well, showing abundant scientific supports and experts’ support, which makes its claims and arguments more authentic. I also felt that this book aims to confuse us about the authenticity of anthropogenic climate change, since it displays a variety of studies showing disagreement upon human-caused climate change among scientists. It also targeted on the statement that 97% scientists have consensus on anthropogenic climate change by revealing that those “97% scientists” are only 79 scientists who answered two survey questions. 
                  <br><br>

Honestly, I think I am more confused now about human-caused climate change after reading the book. Nevertheless, I am also happy that I can hear different voices on the issue, so that I can understand it more thoroughly and clearly. I look forward to further learning on human-caused climate change.

It was pretty difficult for me to read this. Most disturbing to me was the reminder of how committed people are to formulating an entire argument, with evidence or without it, just for the sake of protecting "business as usual." I can see how complicated it is to take such a massive array of scientific data and use it to support an argument, and this is primarily how "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" was crafted. The sheer amount of information can be displayed in many different ways. However I don't think data should be used simply when convenient; woven in to specific arguments and left out of others. The science should simply speak for itself. It's upsetting to see people attempt to refute each other by using different versions of the same information, maybe just because the dishonesty of intentions is so evident. 
                  <br><br>

It really struck me how they criticized the IPCC, saying that for more accurate information we should seek "nongovernmental" organizations. However, the IPCC is run through the UN and is thus a collaboration of 193 different countries and governments. If the scientists are from so many diverse backgrounds, how could anyone argue that they are all trying to push a bias agenda? It seems to me that really the only way to create an unbiased research organization is to ensure it includes people from a wide array of backgrounds. This is exactly what the IPCC does. This book encourages to trust not them but instead those who are paid by energy and fuel companies. For this reason alone any refute they make is essentially invalid.

In all honesty I am alarmed by how easily influenced the general public is. I 100% believe fossil fuel industries and conglomerates alike are horrible in doing what they do but the fact is the facts are right in front of you. People's ability to just be content and comfortable bothers me, it is essential people's mindsets actually change. It's crazy that people only want to make change when absolutely necessary. The statistic of 30% of k-12 teachers who teach their kids that global warming iv very two-sided is sad. People we are supposed to trust, people who "know the answers" are outright wrong. Shows you how poor hearted the world can be, but this also opens up opportunity for unity and growth. I hope change is made now instead of later and targeting mass populations for personal growth shows nothing besides selfishness and in the end you will be the one getting blamed...

When I was reading the book it I thought it was funny. It was a complete joke to me I couldn’t take it seriously at all. The way that the book was written seems very convincing to the average person by using academic words and talking about very important scientists. The reason that I thought that this book was such a joke was because I have been educated by different professors on climate change. My Oceanography professor Lisiecki taught me so much about the effect that we have on our oceans and what we have to come in the future. In this class and my oceanography class I have learned how much human activity is affecting our oceans, our climate patterns and how often we have natural disasters, and this book is trying to disprove the fact that climate change isn’t a real thing just so they can continue to help fossil fuel companies. It is sad the extent that people come to just to make some extra cash. They are putting the whole world in danger by convincing the public that climate change is all a hoax. 
                   <br><br>
It is dangerous that they distributed this book to 300,000 teacher to convince students that climate change is not a real thing. The reason this is dangerous is because kids go back home to tell their parents about their day and tell them all the new things that they learned. If their parents are anything like mine they don’t know much about the subject and they will believe what I tell them about the subject because I have a higher education than they do. This starts a chain reaction on spreading false information because students were taught that climate change isn’t a real problem that we are facing. I think it is so sad on how far companies go just to help themselves out.

The book first attacked Oreskes’ publication on the Science magazine through referring to her as non-expert and 97 percent of peer recognition is the exaggeration instead of the truth in the abstract of her paper. Then it proceed to attack the scientific methods used in the samples. Personally, my own view about this passage is inherently biased, because after studying envs 1 and through analysis of all kinds of material, I am very much aware of the existence of climate change. This book is focusing on the trivial parts of several experiments, which is quite ridiculous. How can a trivial fault influence the general conclusion that global warming is taking place? The book deliberately mixes the idea of existence and accurate prediction. To carry on, the book shows that scientists don’t know exactly what climate change will bring to our world, and then argues that there is no climate change at all. In fact, climate change is something that is going on but not accurately predicted.  However, the uncertainty cannot overlap the fact that the changes are taking place globally. Although the passage seems to quote a lot of information from NASA and many other convincing science institutions,with a much more careful insight I am able to discover that these quotations mainly concentrated on trivial stats such as “97 percent”. Additionally, other sources of its information are from biased press like washington daily and many other famous climate-change denial presses and media. Therefore, the reasoning is nowhere sophisticated and convincing. However, in the lecture, the professor mentions that the sales of the book is actually good, which shows from a direct perspective the stupidity and illogic ideas of climate-change deniers. In the lecture, the professor also mentioned that climate deniers also pay their emphasis on education and teachers to convey their ideas. The tendency can have a destructively detrimental effect as one teacher can teach at least 30 students a year. Thousands of new-generation climate deniers are being educated and this situation should be turned over now.

When reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I attempted to approach it with an open mind in order to understand both perspectives regarding climate change  and reach sure conclusions with consideration of evidence presented from both sides discussed. Obviously, my point of view was already swayed towards belief in anthropogenic climate change; however, I was also aware that I shouldn’t base my belief off of simply the general public’s consensus and “follow the mass” as such approaches leave out individual rationalization. While acknowledging the challenges made against the methodology of surveying Oreskes used, I was disappointed in the fact that book didn’t focus on disproving anthropogenic change itself in order to directly challenge the claims of the 97% consensus. While they attempted to disprove a significant statistic, I felt like the best way to convince the public that their beliefs are wrong would be through the provision of evidence against the harmfulness and effect of human causes towards climate change. Yet the arguments they made against the IPCC were about sources of funding, publication bias, and difference between alarmists and skeptics. I feel like these reasons of argument are also pushed forward by the side of anthropogenic climate change believers as well. The first chapter in general seemed very underwhelming to me in their attempt to convince me. Again, the second chapter expanded upon these reasons among scientists’ disagreements with biases, differences in interdisciplinary studies, and lack of credibility that I found to be extremely redundant. The third chapter itself began to dive into contradictions of methods and lack of scientific evidence that didn’t consider natural causes or true impact of artificial causes.
                   <br><br>


I believe that authorities themselves must firmly come to a consensus on the views of climate change in order for it to be correctly taught within the education system because of the negligence of such information that is limited in teaching as imposed by the bills implemented by a number of states. With many teachers themselves being confused about such evidence and failing to take a side, the government’s confusion itself that ultimately enforces a lack of discussion from teachers restricts the truth from being shared. While institutions like the Heartland Institute receiving funding from major fossil fuel corporations, they themselves are victim of the claims of political and funding bias. Their efforts of spreading misinformation among young students highlights the lasting concern over truth based on facts, which will only further push back the efforts necessary to protect our ecosystems.

I also approached the reading with an open mind and I understand why people would believe this, especially if they are looking for confirmation that climate change isn’t real. The recognition of climate change also recognizes all of the ways we are contributing every day to the problem. Many people don’t want to change the way they live, or can’t imagine an economically viable way to change their lives so they are very willing to accept this information. I am frustrated by the climate change denial efforts because it is so easy to make people doubt an issue like this that is so big and scary, and for many, not yet tangible. I am angry that these massive corporations take advantage of fear and confusion to feed people misinformation. I agree strongly with you that authorities reaching a consensus is important, especially in government. While there is much power in local movements and personal lifestyle choices, leadership is essential in recognizing an issue surrounded by so much debate. The split in our government over climate change only fuels public confusion and doubt about the issue, ultimately postponing not only political change, but also general faith in the issue that would give people a reason to change the ways they live. Solving the climate crisis calls for lifestyle changes, but people aren’t willing to give up meat or live in a smaller home for any reason they aren’t sure of.


<br><Hr>
I agree with you in the sense that I too tied to approach this article with an open mind seeing as I believe climate change is being caused  by humans. I have always been curious about why there are so many skeptics and this book answered by question. Chapter 1 began by questioning the 4 sources cited in the NASA website that claims that there was a 97% consensus that climate change is manmade. They then proceeded to debunk these sources and show how they manipulated the data. This made me seriously doubt the data that I have read. But like Brian I also realized how they focused on getting rid of the consensus and establishing that there was not one but not establishing the fact of whether climate change is manmade or not. However, I can see why debunking the consensus and showing how liberals manipulated the data can attract a wider support for the anti-climate change movement. Conservatives already hate liberals and tend to not believe any studies that are contrary to what they believe. So if you show them that liberals have been lying to the public then they will completely side with the anti climate change movement even more so. This might also lead to conservative teachers to teach this to young impressionable kids which is sad because they might never research this themselves and continue the cycle of manmade climate change deniers.

                   <br><br>

Chapter 2 focused on establishing that scientists get tunnel vision in the specialty they are in and cannot see the bigger picture and therefore cannot establish if climate change will be dangerous. I can see how they convince people to believe that and they even went on to say how uncertain climate science which I do believe. We are not sure what the hell will happen but we know that it won’t be good like this book makes it out to be. Moreover, they go on to insinuate that the IPCC is corrupt and very political. But these anti-climate change groups are also receiving funding from conservative think tanks as much as they deny it and therefore are corrupted as well. However, I understand why this article is very convincing because when they started to show how the IPCC relied on unpublished and non peer reviewed articles I grew a little skeptic of them. I grew even more skeptical when I read about  the way policy makers are influencing them.

                   <br><br>

In chapter 3, they argue that since manmade climate change is a hypothesis then you have to entertain the idea that there is an argument against it and that is that it is natural variability. Since the IPCC has not brought what they considered sufficient evidence they decided there argument is true. I felt like this part of the book also made be very skeptical of the IPCC because they made it seem like the IPCC has no concrete evidence. I now understand why we are meant to read this book. Information can be manipulated very easily and you have to know how to research your facts which a lot of Americans don’t which is why it's easy to sway them to the other side.

I also agree with your value of approaching such topics with an open mind. At surface level, the presentation of information laid out in the first three chapters of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” made the arguments seem credible. With its abundance of citations from seemingly reliable sources such as The Wall Street Journal and academic language, the book seems convincing if one does not look closer into the actual arguments being made and the sources of their data. However, adding on to what you said in your comment, the Heartland Institute argued against the 97% consensus but did not actually directly address the issue of anthropogenic climate change. To me, it seems as though they tried to add as much “fluff” as they could to their argument in order to make it seem viable, but it lacks concrete and meaningful content. In other words, the book danced around the idea of disproving anthropogenic sources of climate change by employing persuasive rhetoric to points that actually lack quality and substance. Even beyond the book itself, it is crucial to consider the agenda of the publisher, the Heartland Institute, and their motives behind it. The material is through the lens of fossil fuel industries and the conservative think tanks that benefit from them, therefore constructing a campaign of misinformation out of self-interest.

I agree with your point about how the general confusion over the issue of climate change is dangerous, especially among influential people such as policy makers and teachers. The fact that only 30% of middle school and 45% of high school teachers selected the correct answer from such a broad range is scary to think about. Even more, I find it cruel that companies such as the Heartland Institute would target young students because we belong to the generation that will have to deal with the impacts of climate change in the future.

<br><Hr>

I disagree partially with the second part of your comment. As the article even states, climate change is an interdisciplinary subject - there must be causes or at least factors that scientists may not have even explored yet, in addition to the ones they have. It's hard to box climate change and limit it to a few simple causes with entirely simple solutions. I think this is why there isn't a consensus, per say, especially with new discoveries regarding the issue arising as time passes.There are numerous approaches to the climate crisis as well as leading factors etc. I'm definitely not speaking on your behalf but I'm saying this within my realm of understanding. In fact, I think the easiest way to teach about the climate crisis could be by identifying major causes and their solutions. I definitely understand the frustration in terms of the way we are being educated about it - it seems scattered and ineffective. Which I could attribute to alarmist approaches.
                   <br><br>

Branching into my own thoughts on the article, I really don't appreciate the hierarchy of global issues.The human mind is capable of focusing on more than one pending issue, and the mentioning of ISIS and terrorism are completely irrelevant even if just to contextualize the argument at hand. Investing in the climate is exactly that - an investment. We won't have any of the issues we're currently faced with if the earth becomes uninhabitable.. I guess that could be a good thing.. maybe I understand why people are denying climate change now. wow.

I found myself really not interested in reading this work simply because of the fact that I did not believe the things that were said in it such as their claim that we live in a world in which we need more CO2. Maybe this is how climate change deniers feel when they read articles which explain the current dire state of our climate, however I feel that all of the evidence that has been compiled in support of the reality that human-caused climate change is here, is real and absolutely terrifying is for more convincing, and accurate. Along with this, after reading this piece after watching the "Merchants of Doubt" film, one part of the article stuck out in particular, in which is attempts to discredit a survey done by the IPCC, stating that it's inaccurate due to the fact  that the majority of the people who took the survey worked for the IPCC. This part of the piece particularly frustrated me because in the documentary it is revealed that many prominent climate change deniers refer to the Oregon Petition as a credible source which proves that tens of thousands of scientists agree that climate change isn't real, when in actuality the petition is full of fake signatures. I don't see how these authors can attempt to discredit organizations such as the IPCC when they themselves have very few true credible sources to back up their own claims. 
                   <br><br>
I also found the amazon reviews for this work to be very surprising as most of the reviews were four or five stars. While there were several negative reviews, the majority was positive, and I found that to be a little scary. The fact that this book is sent to elementary schools is also a bit scary as I would not want this book to be a child's first exposure to the debate around climate change.

I really appreciate this exercise in reviewing both sides of the climate crisis as it is necessary to understand both sides of a very important argument. After reading through the article and my classmates comments there are a few things that I would like to take away. The first being the repeating notion of measured "confidence". Many of the findings the paper brings up relates to the surveyed level of confidence that "experts" have in reports. In the Bray and Von Storch report, the paper addresses the the differences in skepticism and confidence among scientists opinion on the climate crisis and global warming. I for one do not see the importance in skepticism and confidence regarding cold hard facts. They say there is no scientific consensus based on the idea that all scientists have full confidence in all the effects of climate change. 
                   <br><br>
Another problem I had with some of the prefacing is the way the book was marketed as it "sold and gave away" 50,000 copies which they use to make it sound the like the book is selling very well, rendering it as reliable. However, the article fails to mention the ratio of these sales to "giveaways". Additionally, recipients included in these giveaways are k-12 schools. This is very disheartening to learn in that they are deliberately attempting to dissuade the youth of America to either ignore the effects of climate change.

When reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I have to say that this article seems convincing, but also really deceiving. If I haven’t read the first two weeks’ readings and watched the documentaries, I would believe that the results of the climate change wouldn’t be that bad. It provided a lot facts and statistics, although we don’t know if they are accurate or based on reliable sources, people will believe. Since we often believe in these kinds of “scientific and reliable” things with many statistics and numbers. Also, I saw the statistics that  “97% of scientists” believe in that climate change was caused by anthropogenic activities again. If people only care about statistics, why don’t they believe in this data. “97%” is definitely enough for people to be alarmed. I was actually attracted by this article in the beginning, until I found that the author was attacking this data, and it tried to convince people how 97% of the scientist have not actually agreed and I was a little upset when reading these. The numbers can be attacked or doubted, but what about the catastrophes that really happened, just like the fire in Paradise, the reason the fire spread so quickly is because of the hotter temperature and global warming which were mainly cause by people and human-made fossil fuels. And I wonder why the authors decided to write an article to deny the climate change was made by human activities. Maybe they think it will cause panic or fear. But, If people don’t know anything, they can’t do anything, they will still ride their cars everything, consume many things that they don’t actually need. These will only lead to worse situations. And if we are at the situation that the disasters are so apparent and these truth cannot be hided anymore. We will be at the stage that do anything is useless. So, why these truths can’t be showed to people. If everybody acknowledges the issue, we can do things together to try to somehow make it better.

After reading Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, I started to question what I truly knew about climate change. I was thinking to myself, maybe it’s not as bad as I think it is??? I thought maybe I’ve only been hearing issues from alarmists when the facts might point to something else. But then I realized that this book was just getting to me. I was about to allow the book to cloud my judgement but I remembered Ken talking about the conservatives who wrote this book. Their intentions were selfish, trying to convince people that climate change isn’t as bad as everyone says it is. Instead of informing the public, they are only pushing their own agendas to stay rich and in power. It’s concerning to think this book has the power to change people’s minds about the severity of climate change. It’s alarming that people who don’t know much about climate change could read this book and believe that climate change isn’t an issue. Those people will probably lose interest in climate change after reading it’s not an issue to worry over. 
                   <br><br>

I was annoyed after watching Ken’s video, when I found out this book was given to teachers. Instead of teaching kids about the most important issue this planet faces, teachers resort to other things as this book has clouded their judgement. This book is only one example of conservatives/big businesses pushing their agendas for the good of themselves and not the good of the masses. They are more concerned about their wealth than the lives of their kids and grandchildren. 
                   <br><br>

One of the first steps to working against climate change will be to educate the masses. In order to make a change, people need to be aware of the prominent issues of climate change and rally together to fight off large corporations and conservative officials.

After reading the book, "Why Scientists Disagree about climate change," I was fairly frustrated and upset. The use of deception and misinformation in hopes to cause confusion is not ok. It is appalling to hear that fossil fuel companies are attempting to deprioritize the urgency of this issue. On the other hand, I could see how this book could put thoughts into the heads of some people and potentially pursued them to abandon their original views. It is unnerving that these companies are sending this to teachers of k-12 students, potentially influencing future generations. The minds of the young are easily influenced and the falsities presented have no place in their brains. The fact that the Heartland Institute is a conservative think tank should immediately discredit the book, but it is reasonable to believe that not everyone will know that. After watching Ken's video, it was crazy to see how much effort and time fossil fuel companies use to discredit that the state of our climate is a pressing issue.

This piece was a difficult read, not because of its density or surplus of scientific vocabulary, but because it displayed sheer ignorance and (false) denial of the climate crisis. Because it was so seemingly well-written and was packed with so much supposed believable scientific data, it worries me that others having less knowledge of the truth of the situation who may read this will find it compelling and join the side of stupidity. I found the “Global Warming Petition Project” was the hardest part to read, as it is just simply and completely false to assume that because carbon dioxide is necessary for the planet within reasonable amounts that these benefits would increase with the increase of it. Sure, the planet could not survive without CO2, but too much of it inhibits its survival, as well. It is worrisome that those who read the piece without the awareness of who funded it and which companies back the scientists that agree with such statements may take it as the truth and not see through the web of money and private interests.
                   <br><br>

 Although I support the concept of educators acknowledging there are two sides of the debate simply to have an awareness of the politics of the issue, I find it manipulative and obvious evidence of a power play that copies of this book were uninvitedly sent to 300,000 teachers, without representation for the other side of the debate, with the hope that they would spread this misinformation to the growing minds of the youth before the truth could be expressed. It is clear that those supporting the denial of the climate crisis are clever in their means of distributing their ideas, which is unfortunate for the sake of the planet.

“Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change”:                   <br><br>

What did I just read? They have the AUDACITY to say that we live in a CO2-starved world. Seriously? I’m still shook from how wrong the statement is. 
                   <br><br>

Who else was unaffected by the book’s arguments about “no consensus”? To me, that argument is completely irrelevant. How can they discredit the science behind global warming due to a lack of consensus, while they are trying to say that their claims are also backed by scientists. I’m positive that they don’t have a consensus. So why do they stress its importance so much? It’s ironic that they state that consensus is needed for validity, but they don’t have it themselves.
                   <br><br>

Another point that the book argues is that the scientists for climate change are unreliable just because they're not individually experts in every field of science. It also made me mad that they describe the warming as something that “may or may not happen” even though it’s currently happening.

I appreciate seeing a comment that is authentically communicating a completely normal reaction to this book. I'm angry as well. Mostly, I'm saddened. We've been assigned many materials at this point that communicate how dark the future is if we don't act. However, there's always an "if". Meaning if everyone drops what they're doing and teams up to fight this thing, we totally have a chance to save millions. Unfortunately, that's never happened before in human history, and I'm thinking people would rather go to war over this than accept it as how things are. Normally, I keep my head up and think that people will eventually come around. After reading this and the top comments on Amazon, I don't think that's true. 
                   <br><br>
I had two reactions to this text. The first was a realization that the Heartland Institute thinks we're stupid, and I felt offended. My second reaction was that sending out thousands of copies of a dangerous text like this should absolutely be illegal. Then I remembered that the Constitution exists. Some people just want to watch the world burn (shoutout Batman Begins). In this case, it literally will. I think I may be convinced now that we are not going to overcome climate change. People just won't have it. If anyone has a beautifully constructed argument that can convince me otherwise, I hope to hear it tomorrow.
<br><Hr>

I agree with you, the fact that they mention “no consensus” really made me not want to read the rest of the text. It was just gonna be nonsense on why climate change is not real. I think we all know that CO2 helps our plants but the problem is that we are producing so much CO2. The climate change deniers think that we need to stop producing all the CO2 in the world and that will eventually kill all the plants. But what us climate change activists want is for us to not produce so much CO2. There is evidently an optimal amount of CO2 that we need in our atmosphere and we are way passed it. 
                   <br><br>
Also the section where they discredit the science of climate change because no one can know everything is so dumb. There are so many things wrong with that statement and it justs shows how ignorant climate change deniers are.
                   <br><br>
Also the final section where they try to discredit ICPP is just so absurd they really made NICPP to debunk them and it is just so ridiculous because it seems like they are just attacking the ICPP and not the facts that the ICPP present.

I really agree with the statement you made. It is truly shocking to think that there are so many people and so much money behind the ideology that global warming is a farce. It almost seems as if the Heartland Institute takes pride in belittling the life work of so many scientists and activists who have poured so much energy into bringing attention to the Climate Crisis. This propaganda was not only created to misinform the masses but is successful in removing the blame from those who wrote it, along with their affiliates. In a time where the only thing we need to focus on is saving ourselves, many people are years away from taking any factual evidence seriously. Our own President jokes about global warming as if the only thing we need are air conditioners in closed spaces. Not only is it happening, it's happening now and it is saddening to see so many people pour so much effort into hiding the truth.

After reading "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming" I was left a bit confused. When I think of a scientist I think of someone extremely knowledgable about a topic, and yet while reading I was just hit with facts and stats that weren't being proven. The book in a way revealed that sometimes those who are putting out articles on climate change may not be totally reliable on the topic, and may be biased due to big corporations like fossil fuel companies. As I read the book one thing I noticed was the tone of voice throughout. The author maintained a calm, level-headed tone even while talking about alarming topics. This in comparison to typical climate change alarmists makes the author appear rational and not worried. For someone who isn't really informed on the issue of climate change, reading this would probably lead them to believe that there is not immediate threat from climate change. Another thing I noticed is that while I know how big of a threat climate change is, the book almost had me believing that we really aren't in any imminent danger, and I think that is a scary skill for someone to have.

This was very difficult for me to read for a variety of reasons. The first reason is that the first three chapters make some good points that make sense. The second reason is that the book is structured in such a strange and deliberately offsetting way. The third reason is that it is crazy to think that the people who wrote the book actually believe in what they are writing about. The book makes attempt after attempt to show why we can’t be absolutely certain of the causes and impacts of climate change. And, when looked at in this way, this is probably true. However, it is still massively obvious that humans are causing climate change and it is still massively obvious how humans are causing climate change. This book constantly brings up obscure stats from specific studies to confuse the reader into ultimately believing what the writers want the reader to believe: that we can’t reach a consensus as to global warming and climate change. This is simply ridiculous, insane, and unbelievable, and I am glad to be done with the reading.

After reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change" I was very unsure about how I felt about their points behind climate change. Scientists continue to use the same argument that climate change is not real, but how are they professionals to express proof but do not actually try to show their proof behind their belief that climate crisis and global warming is not real? Personally, I believe global warming and climate change continues to occur and scientists are being fairly ignorant about what is actually going on in our world when it comes to climate crisis. In chapter two of "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change," it is expressed that "[s]cientists are often optimistic about the safety of the environment when it relates to subjects encompassing their own area of research and expertise, but are pessimistic about risks outside their range of expertise." With this, I completely agree. Many individuals, including professionals do not tend to care and are ignorant behind certain facts that do not relate to their works. For example, in the text it uses professionals like physicians, in the previous film we watched about Paradise, it was showcased that medical professionals were stopped from their job due to a fire. The reason I am bringing this example up is simply because physicians do not go to work thinking about climate crisis and in this reading it is expressed that they may even completely disagree on climate crisis, but those involved in the fire in Paradise, I'm sure, had a complete wake up call that day that climate crisis and global warming is definitely a serious topic and is definitely occurring more and more each day. Many arguments in this reading, in my opinion, is flawed. Also, giving this reading to teachers simply plays an impact on how teachers may or may not explain the "truth" behind climate change. From experiences, I do not remember any of my science teachers(specifically) ever talking about climate change, especially whether or not it is true. I used to continue my life hearing about global warming from other individuals like other students and even in the news. Although, it was not until I got to college, especially here at UCSB, did I finally realize how real global warming is. Climate change is simply serious and teachers should inform their students as early as possible how important it is to help the planet instead of continuing to destroy it.

I was trying to carry an open-minded mindset while reading through this book. I was genuinely intrigued at what’s like at the other side of the wall on this issue, or understand their arguments. As one who might not be very familiar about this issue, he / she might easily be persuaded by this book. However, for someone who has some background information about Climate Crisis, they can easily spot the fallacy out of this book. The author, on the surface level, is trying to approach this issue in a bias-free style, but after finishing the whole piece, we can definitely tell that the author is trying to convince the readers that Climate change is an issue that we should not be worrying about. Despite the author is laying out a large amount of statistics for the reader, it is not hard to see that these data only tells only part of the story. As any person who has some experience handling the data, we should all know that it’s a fatal mistake to draw conclusions from only pieces of the whole data. Data extracted from these fashion is usually biased and unreliable. Therefore, it would not be surprising that the author behind this book is lack of scientific authority and credibility, and this piece would not stand much reliability too. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, I find it funny that the author is claiming that they are the ones being oppressed and they are the minority. This reminds of a meme I saw recently: “You are not just wrong, you are also stupid.” The reason that he / she thinks this way is because they are fighting for the wrong case. Information like this is corrupting not only our generation, but also the generation coming after us. We need to be properly educated on this issue of climate change. Meanwhile, it angers me when major oil companies pour funds into these kind of false propaganda to prevent us and future generations from recognizing the harm of Climate change for their own benefits.

Prior to reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I expected to see some convincing evidence as to why there is no consensus regarding the climate crisis. I went in thinking that my thoughts about climate change may be swayed or even questioned. However, after reading it, I can say with certainty that this book did not convince me that scientists are not sure whether the climate crisis is happening or not. If anything, this book only served to confuse me. Instead of offering evidence from their own scientific experiments and research, the authors focused on trying to debunk the methods used by other scientists. I believe that the authors tried to throw a bunch of data and statistics at the reader in an effort to confuse them and deceive them that scientists are unsure about whether or not climate change is real. 
<br><br>


Getting through the first three chapters of the book was quite tough for me because all I could think about was how inaccurate this was. Not only was this boring to read, I found it hard to believe anything that was published in this book because of their connection to fossil fuel industries. Fossil fuel companies have a lot at stake here so they are clearly invested in spreading the denial of climate change. I also found it despicable how they would send a copy of this book, unsolicited, to 300,000 school teachers. Young children are easily influenced and look to their teachers as a credible and reliable source of information. By sending this book to school teachers, they are hoping to spread the denial of climate change and influence the beliefs of the next generation. 
<br><br>


It is surprising to me how little teachers know in regards to the issue of climate change. I was shocked to learn that 30% of K-12 teachers that teach climate change teach their students that it is a two-sided argument and that “many scientists” see natural causes behind recent global warming. Another thing that stood out to me was how more than half of K-12 teachers did not teach this issue at all. I had always thought that climate change was covered in school. The lack of education regarding climate change is what makes it so easy for climate skeptics to target those unaware of the truth.

I too believed that the article, "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change", would answer the controversial opinions and questions that many have in regards to the climate crisis. As you had stated, "instead of offering evidence from their own scientific experiments and research, the authors focused on trying to debunk the methods used by other scientists." I know that the book and a chapter was simply devoted to explain why scientists disagree with one another, but instead of using the opportunity to inform many on a solution, they simply stated that the reason why scientists disagree is because they come from separate fields of study and hence have "tunnel vision". I believe we can all understand that if two people from different areas of expertise were to answer a question regarding the climate crisis and its origins they would have two completely separate answers. Fields of study are extremely different from one another and address/approach a situation differently based on what that area values. I believe that this book was a wasted opportunity in being able to unify scientists from various fields to collaborate and develop a mutual understanding on the climate crisis. I believe that once scientists are able to share their findings and efficiently communicate with one another, they could uncover a great result that would help all of man kind. We need to stop separating the fields and discouraging others, because in the end, they are all supposed to have the same end goal in trying to save our planet.

After reading the first half of, ¨Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming¨ and watching Ken`s video, I would be lying if I said it was not a frustrating read. To start out, many of the statistics are unreliable and only given in an attempt to change the minds of readers. The far more problematic idea surrounding the paper is that it is clearly propaganda towards children or people without much knowledge on the subject. Heartland Institute giving out 300,000 copies in an effort to target children and children`s teachers is close to a criminal act in my opinion. I was utterly shocked upon reading that and it ensured my feelings on the piece. With all of that being said, the piece was actually very well written and statistics were given in a manner that I could see many believing. I actually caught myself a few times at the beginning of the article thinking of how much of a problem that was. Without Ken`s preface to the reading and previous knowledge on the matter, I would read that and certainly consider that side of the argument. For those reasons this was an incredibly eerie reading due to the fact people will read and buy into these arguments. The wealthy will clearly go to great extents to get people on board with them and in turn make more money, which is also hard to accept. In closing, I want to talk about one statistic that really stood out to me as well as other students as seen in the comments. It was the author`s distaste with the study proving that 97% of scientists believe in anthropogenic climate change, and how he believed this study is inaccurate. In no way am I saying that study truly did account for every single scientist out there, nor was it perfect, but that high number is definitely close to accurate and shouldn´t be something one nitpicks with. The intentions of this reading are masked behind big words and statistics, but I hope this piece and others like it do not get the hands of many people, especially when young.

Although this week’s reading may have instilled some doubt in its readers, I think it is very important for both sides of this argument to be heard. As one of the largest global issues today, the climate crisis should also be taught, in my opinion. As I was reading other comments on this video, I noticed that many of my peers agree that school is a place of learning and one that should supply accurate and unbiased information. After reading the first three chapters of the book, as well as the webpage reviewing it, I was upset to see its attempt to target our generation, convincing them that climate change isn’t real. By sending copies of this book to K-12 schools and college science teachers across America, they are attempting to teach climate change skepticism. As I said before, I agree with the importance of being informed of both sides of this argument, but I believe that teaching climate change denial is taking it too far. We are our country’s future and we have the right to make our own decisions on the topic; to see the facts without being biased by our teachers. 
<br><br>

I had a hard time getting through this reading as I struggled with believing that their arguments against climate change came off as biased and their sources less than credible. Therefore, I also want to address the points that were made in this reading and how unimpactful I found them. As I was reading, the verbage and language used alone made the arguments less than convincing. It seemed as though they knew they couldn’t reveal too much information because they knew they would be judged by their every word; one false statistic or a too opinionated statement could ruin their entire book. "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" argued that there is “no consensus” on the most important scientific issues, despite claims by advocates to the contrary. They used fact that scientists disagree as a point in their claim. But is it not true that science is based around observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and argument? If all scientists agreed on every subject, we would have no new technology or new information about our world. They also argued that the topic of climate change requires insights from many fields and very few scholars have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines. They say this as if the climate crisis needs to be proven by a single person. If hundreds of advocates, from of these “necessary” fields are building and finding evidence that supports this issue, why is that not enough? As Ken reiterates in this video, 97% of scientists believe that climate change is a fact.

I completely agree. Each of your talking points were topics that I wanted to comment on as well. Like you said, I appreciate that Ken is exposing us to both sides of the story. While I think he may have been a bit too concerned that we would start to believe what these massive oil industries are manipulating the public to believe, reading "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming" definitely opened my eyes to the ignorance that these organizations are spreading to the public. What hit me the hardest is the fact that these phony climate change deniers are going as far as to infect the minds of school children with the idea that this whole thing is a hoax. I find that cruel. I find it hard to believe that their conscience would let them spread such maliciously intended content to kids whom trust and believe what their teachers say.  The current school children are the ones who will be affected the most by the boomer generation and generation z, and implementing a seed of doubt at such a young age can have such a profound impact in their beliefs which they do not deserve. The children deserve a future but with selfish, money-hoarding companies such as the Koch Brothers or The Heartland institute whom are funding the distribution of climate change denial books, they are only hurting the chances of future generations to rise up and take a stand against the use of fossil fuels.

The book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is an oddly convincing, but extremely deceiving book. While the author provided "facts" and stats that seem like they could be true, it is shown that they are not backed up whatsoever. The title of this book is quite ironic since Ken enlightened us that scientists, at least now, dont disagree about global warming. As with other writings that infer climate change isn't real, I found myself getting increasingly frustrated at this author. Is that the point of the book? I felt as if the tone of the book was quite attacking and somewhat uncomfortable to read. These authors took studies that supported their ideas and twisted them in a way that almost sounds convincing. But, since we watched a Climate of Doubt, it was a little easier to spot where these authors were manipulating studies.
<br><br>
Books like these are the reason why people still have doubt. Spreading this twisted informations is going to be a factor in why we cannot combat climate change. it is almost unethical to publish a book with so many manipulated words, ignored scientists, and false information.

As I am reading through the book "Why Scientist Disagree About Climate Change," I feel like I am reading a strongly purposeful and well-constructed debunking essay that attacks clearly to all institutions or people that believe in an anthropogenic climate change. The whole work is actually very convincing and easy to follow along with strong and straightforward thesis statements and supporting evidence. It also tries so hard to resonate with the audience by replacing the arguments from IPCC with their own researches. The point here is that this book is highly purposeful which contains a great power to affect a lot of people. As Ken points out that the targeted audiences are basically teachers, children, and leaders in areas, I find out that the work is not only purposeful but also malicious. What the NIPCC tries to do here is to mislead the leading generations and future generations of people in a way that could lead humanity and earth to an end. This is unacceptable. The writers of the book also attack directly to the scientists and aggressively defy the field of science. As they name Naomi as a socialist historian with no science background, Naomi is actually a professor who has studied for historical science for years and what she does is using her expertise to tell the fact to people. I am so tired of the beneficial relationships between these institutes and large parties of fossil fuels because they are doing what the cigarette industry has done before. They are trying to lock our minds and delay strong legislations to stop CO2 emissions which is just like the story of cigarettes. What will this do then and what is the impact? It is that we will waste our valuable time and even make the time delay of climate change even worse to a point that we can never do anything about it. Just imagine how sad it is.

Although I do not agree with this text, there were some good points that were made about the representation of the opinions of those who oppose or doubt climate change. When describing the difference in productivity between alarmists and skeptics, the point of publication bias was brought up: “Publication bias – articles that “find something,” such as a statistically significant correlation that might suggest causation, are much more likely to get published than those that do not.” It makes sense that facts and studies are more likely to get published than doubts or ideas involving skepticism. They are arguing that it isn’t fair to publish one side without the other. I agree, there should be equal representation, however the content that is being published still won’t convince most that climate change isn’t real. After all, they are complaining that they don’t have enough facts or evidence to get published. Another good point comes when discussing the bias in science. “Scientists, no less than other human beings, bring their personal beliefs and interests to their work and sometimes make decisions based on them that direct their attention away from research findings that would contradict their opinions.” While this may be true to some extent (bias is present in all areas of study), 97% of scientists that are confirming climate change is real and happening currently. It seems unlikely that this large of a number of scientists could all be biased.

I was incredibly confused while reading this because everything just felt so wrong. The book touts itself as a worthy inclusion to the climate change debate, but there were a lot of facts and statistics that were supposedly unreliable because of bias and non-credible sources. The main claim of this book is that there is no survey or study showing "consensus" on the climate debate, but I feel like this argument was only possible because they only gave examples of articles  that could not be accurate. This is an insidious strategy on the authors' end because it causes the audience to lean toward trusting the writer and not the climate researchers the book discusses. After closer examination, it is clear to see that the narrator's view is incredibly biased-- instead of actually talking about the data, they tended to go after the credibility of the scientists who conducted the studies. The book also contained reviews praising their previous works, however they were all from people who have nothing to do with climate science. If they do not have a background in the topic, how are they to know if the data or claims made are wrong? The fact that fossil fuel interests are going to measures such as sending this book to K-12 teachers as propaganda is alarming as well. These are people who educate the children of the country, after all. They are considered trusted sources, and the Heartland Institute decided to send 300,000 copies of this without any prompting, for free.

This book was more well written than I expected and seems totally legitimate until I stopped and read the content slowly. They use a lot of facts and numbers in an attempt to overwhelm and confuse the reader but most of that information is not grounded in anything. As I was reading the book, even after knowing it was funded by conservative think tanks, I was still partially convinced of its validity until I slowed down and read it carefully. 
<br><br>

I think it’s interesting that by sending out the books to teachers, the writers are trying to convince schoolchildren that climate change isn’t real. I think that is ridiculous that they’re targeting unsusceptible children. Regardless of what a person believes, I think it’s morally wrong to try push your beliefs this aggressively on people who won’t know any better, like “stealing candy from a baby.”

Watching this video connected with me on many different levels. Many of my elementary school teachers would deny climate change, and my science teachers would often say it is still up for debate. The figure of 97% is quite alarming actually, in regards to climate change being practically undisputed. That is only 3% of people saying they don't think climate change is real, and there are always going to be people doubting facts. It is somewhere between 1.2-2% of people surveyed who believe the earth is still flat. Reading the book was interesting. Reading phrases like "Climate Change Reconsidered" was interesting, as if it was previously dismissed as a non-issue, and just MIGHT have some validity now. I will say that reading that a reason for climate change still being disagreed on because of it being is an interdisciplinary subject was eye opening. Page 31 lists the fields climate change can concern "from astronomy, biology, botany, cosmology, economics, geochemistry, geology, history, oceanography, paleontology, physics, and
<br><br>
scientific forecasting and statistics, among other disciplines." adding "Very few scholars in the field have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines." This sparks the idea that their may be personal gain from people in these fields denying climate change. Most of these people conduct research, much of which they could not do without burning fossil fuels. If these people deny it, it could be for personal motives, and this should be realized.

This reading was really difficult for me to get through. When reading the comments I noticed that many of my peers share my discomfort regarding this particular assignment. Thus far in this class, nearly all of the content we have been exposed to has been troubling in its own way; consequently, this is not the first piece of material I have encountered that has frustrated me. However, this reading was unique because its goals seemed the most inherently biased. Regardless of your view on climate change, it seems evident that this article is objectively and purposely misleading. It reminded me constantly that statistics in this day and age are so easily manipulated that they can almost never be trusted. After completing the reading I recalled an old adage "it is impossible to fill a cup that is already full." In essence, it means that once someone is convinced of something it is very difficult to change their viewpoint, regardless of the evidence against them. In relation to this article, I found it incredibly disgusting that this piece of text was geared tword a younger, more impressionable audience. The clearly convoluted "facts" proposed, while unsettling to most of us who are already somewhat educated on the topic, could be easily accepted by less informed individuals. This brings up a very scary fact about climate crisis rhetoric: in a world where "truth" has become very subjective it is nearly impossible to formulate a clear picture of what exactly climate change is. 
<br><br>


In my opinion, this is the most daunting obstacle of climate change today. Of course, we should be focusing on mitigating the damage caused by humans, however, we cannot begin to do that without first achieving a global consensus on what exactly the climate crisis is and how our actions may affect the situation at hand. With so many people benefiting from anthropocentric emissions, this is a more difficult challenge than it may at first seem. That is why my main takeaway from this book is that we need more classes like this one being taught earlier in development. The only way our generation will be able to make a change is if we begin to educate our populous on the situation before they are infected with propaganda such as this article.

While I disagree with many of the lines of reasoning and conclusions in the book, I do not agree with some of the comments on this post that are quick to dismiss the entirety of the book and label it "right wing misinformation." Even though the Heartland Institute has an undeniable bias, and receives extensive funding from sources such as the Koch foundation, this does not mean that the book is completely devoid of truth and perspectives worthy of consideration and respect. As Ken described in lecture on Friday, one of the noteworthy parts of the book is how extensively the book uses citations from sources that appear credible. While in many cases these sources are manipulated by the author and misrepresent the source, it is wrong to completely ignore all the parts of the book and discard its findings. 
<br><br>
One part of the book that I think is worthy of discussion is how there are deliberate attempts to oversimplify climate science in order to make it easier for people without extensive scientific education to understand the issue. While it is undeniable that such oversimplifications are necessary to achieve political change in many cases, I was sympathetic to the books discussion of how political activism and scientific inquiry have become blurred, resulting in some cases where traditional scientific methods and standards have been sacrificed in order to achieve a preordained political objective. This discussion of the oversimplification and misrepresentation of facts also made me consider some of the arguments made in comments and the sources used in this course. I think that some people are too committed to achieving political goals and in turn make scientifically false or misleading claims.
<br><br>
It would be remiss of me to not admit I was intrigued by some of the evidence presented in the book. Even though I understand the bias of the Heartland Institute and acknowledge that many of the claims made in the book are misleading, I think there is truth to the argument that the popular arguments made about climate change do have some scientific flaws in them. I think this is most important when considering the fact that the current policy proposals to combat climate change, such as the Green New Deal, are extremely  far-reaching pieces of legislation. Even if you believe that climate change is going to fundamentally alter human life in short order, you must admit that such legislation would have a long lasting impact on the U.S. economy and change the lives of all citizens. Now, if we introduce some doubt about the veracity of scientific claims that motivate such legislation, I think it is fair for people to be apprehensive about supporting such policies. While many would say these people have fallen prey to the "disinformation" of this book, I think we must recognize and sympathize with these people and work to find consensus and achieve meaningful change.

I found this article to be slightly laughable. It was hard for me to finish it, and quite frankly I didn’t want to. Back in 12th grade, my environmental science teacher warned my class about these types of articles and “anti-alarmist” ideologies. When I first began reading it, the first thing I noticed was this repetition of the article discrediting the IPCC and saying “there is no consensus” or that the scientific findings are flawed. However, there is never solid evidence of this presented. Perhaps it’s the way they are phrasing the “evidence” that makes people become persuaded, but the article is FILLED with such obvious confirmation bias. Ken highlighted on how their works cited are mostly coming from the same source. They add very few credible sources, and I would assume that they do that to really solidify this idea that this entire article is legitimate. Anyone that has done any type of research paper knows that if you are arguing a point, you need to make sure that you’re reading and citing credible sources that also go against your view. That way, you’re taking in all perspectives of the argument. If you only or mostly identify sources that support your argument, it is quite obviously confirmation bias.
<br><br>

However, I can see how this article is convincing for some. Even though I ultimately disagree with the article, the way they presented pieces of evidence was an interesting move. It caught my attention when they were discussing how surveys sent to scientists were biased, and I could see how people would see that as credible evidence considering that self-reported surveys have major flaws and can misconstrue the statistics revolved around the study. Their rhetoric is also very successful at connecting dots that people otherwise wouldn’t be connecting, which is evident even in the “Foreword” message. The people who are in support of this article are those who already oppose climate change being real. 
<br><br>

The most upsetting part about it is how this entire book is that is was sent to many K-12 teachers. Bias should not be taught. What should be presented is evidence that we do indeed have. It’s fine to present opposing views because, as I said before, you absolutely must look at all perspectives to successfully formulate a good argument or to simply understand why you have the view you have. If we introduce bias such as this, it just straight up confuses people.

You would think that a book titled "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" would actually address the reasons and evidences behind why scientists disagree about global warming. However, from what I have read, a good portion of the book instead addresses the alleged inaccuracies in statistics of how many scientists actually believe in anthropogenic climate change. The majority of the book is based on "debunking" the numbers  of scientists who believe climate change is real, and not about the science and evidence behind why anthropogenic climate change is not real. The authors are simply trying to discredit the numbers, while avoiding their scientific research and proof against anthropogenic climate change. And even when these deniers finally provide data to prove their skepticism, a lack of credible information is offered to the readers. For example, the authors try to discredit climate scientists by saying "climate is an interdisciplinary subject" and that very few climate scientists "have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines". However, a few pages later, the authors themselves continue to sanctimoniously quote meteorologists, saying that "only 52 percent of AMS members who responded to its survey reported believing the warming of the past 150 years was man-made". I found this comical, as the authors utterly contradict what they said previously about how climate science is an interdisciplinary subject and that most climate scientists aren't qualified to to be taken as credible when the authors themselves later quote the The American Meteorological Society(a single discipline of science) as their irrefutable data.  
<br><br>


After reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", my belief of anthropogenic climate change has only been further confirmed due to the authors' utter hypocrisy and lack of credibility. If these deniers are truly trying to convince the public that anthropogenic climate change is not real, they should probably provide their own evidence to why climate change is not linked to human actions and hypotheses to what may be causing the climate change as supposed to purely "debunking" the research and facts found by diligent climate scientist who only wish to stop the world from its own destruction.

I went to a high school in a relatively conservative town. My freshman year of high school, I remember the honors biology teacher explaining how climate change was a hoax only perpetuated to continue taxing Americans. I took this to be true. At that point, I was thirteen years old and wasn’t presented with other information that would contradict his argument. It wasn’t until my junior year of high school that I began to question what the teachers motives were for spreading misinformation to 13 and 14 year olds. I then realized how many of my classmates were not going to have the same realization as I did about climate change. In my high school, only about 20 students a year take the AP Environmental Science class, and only about 15 continue on to university after high school. Many of my classmates, most likely, still believe that climate change is a hoax because of this teacher, and will see it only as a ploy used to tax Americans.

<br><br>

In regards to the reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change” I found many of the arguments used to be flawed. The authors argue that climate change is caused by natural processes like the Milankovich cycles, and natural variability of the Earth’s temperature. They mentioned that a warming of 2C is within the Earth’s natural variability, which is true. The Earth’s climate naturally varies with or without human activity, but these processes take tens of thousands of years. The authors failed to mention how the temperature has been increasing at an exponential rate since the Industrial Revolution. The human species hasn’t been around to experience a drastic heating like the one we are experiencing right now. If the intent of the article was to state that the Earth is going to be fine if we continue to burn fossil fuels, I agree. The Earth is going to be fine, but the millions of species that inhabit the earth will run out of food, water, habitable shelter, will most certainly not be fine.

it honestly sucks hearing your first experience learning about climate change. What bothers me is the overbearing problem of people with money trying to manipulate kids. Especially with your teacher in how he found he problem was that caring about climate change would lead to higher taxes. In my own high school experience, I faced the opposite. In freshman year biology I remember spending a least 2-3 days covering climate change and the basic chemistry (despite it not being in the course curriculum). To this day I am amazed how simple it is to understand the basic chemistry and reasoning behind climate change, yet we find a need for there to be some full written out study or "consensus."

Actually reading the first 3 chapters was legit painful. It felt like some convoluted, exaggerated  counterargument paragraph I would've written in high school. Not to say that it wasn't well organized or thought out, but I felt little to know justification or support for the arguments that were being made. The paper was riddled with hypocrisy, even from the get go; the paper criticizes scientists for receiving lobbyist and political backing while their very own organizations and think tanks receive funding from fossil fuel companies.  
<br><br>

Ordinarily, I'm all for listening to all aspects of an issue and being open to the idea of hey, what if I'm wrong? The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” has turned me away completely. Im curious to see what people without a financial motive have to say against climate change.



<br><hr>
I really appreciate you sharing a personal story of being taught that climate change does not exist. Having grown up in a liberal area, almost all of my teachers and peers believed that climate change was real and advocated for positive change, so it’s hard for me to wrap my head around people truly believing otherwise. It makes me realize how important it is that we not only need to reduce emissions, change how we consume, etc. but also educate others. Simply spreading awareness of the issue is SO important -  the more people working to combat the crisis, the more effectively we can change things. 
<br><br>
As for the article, “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change”, I find it remarkable at how effective it was at convincing me that what I thought I knew about climate change was… false. If I didn’t go in knowing that what I was about to read was a ploy to get me to doubt the existence of the climate crisis, I would have completely fallen for it. Their attempt to discredit the assertion that climate change is anthropogenic was fairly convincing, it really did make it seem as though there was a chance that it could just be natural variability - but I did wonder one thing: where was the data to back this up? If I wasn’t looking for it specifically, I would have overlooked the ways in which they try to persuade the reader to doubt statistics about climate change. You pointed out how “the authors failed to mention how the temperature has been increasing at an exponential rate since the Industrial Revolution”. I think this is a perfect example of their how their data was misleading - they claimed that changes in temperature occur naturally but by leaving out such an important fact, they skew the picture of the climate crisis.

Through the video I learned why most teachers choose to avoid talking and not to teach about the changing weather. Most teachers themselves don't know exactly what the weather is all about. Teachers are also confused by a lot of misleading information and data, but teachers are the ones who educate their children, which can lead only a few children to have the will to know about the changes in the weather.
<br><br>

It is also compared to the fact that the study of climate changes by meteorologists is like that of blind people trying to learn about an elephant through touching it from all different aspects, which means even though they are trying to investigate weather conditions, are doing little or nothing more than trying to show that the findings of scientists and meteorologists don't tell the truth or draw any substantial conclusions. It is precisely this that has led to why only a few people agree with weather changes and why most teachers choose not to teach the topic of weather problems. However, there are many places in the article the author obviously did not make clear the conclusion, the hasty end is confusing, cannot help but make people doubt about the article.
<br><br>
Thus I hope more people could start to understand and take action to improve climate change.

While a lot about this article made me angry just by the blatant misinformation and bias, there were a few key moments that made me especially frustrated. I did find that this book, as Ken pointed out, was really well written in hopes to convince you that their morals/messages are the truth, which was really troubling. The way they phrase their “facts” does a good job making you re-think what you know to be true. However, there were many moments in the reading that snapped me out of it and showed how incorrect the information they’re sharing is, especially the fact that they’re trying to teach it to children. In particular, their call for unbiased scientists and organizations “IPCC, created to find and disseminate research finding a human impact on global climate, is not a credible source. It is agenda-driven, a political rather than scientific body, and some allege it is corrupt [...] policymakers should seek out advice from independent, non government organizations and scientists who are free of financial and political conflicts of interest” when this article itself is so chock-full of bias (they cite the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank funded by big oil working solely to convince people the climate crisis isn’t real) and misinformation is really ironic. The people who wrote this book are very clearly trying to make themselves seem as reliable of “scientists” as possible by just throwing in scientific jargon into random sentences and stating them as fact; but when you read the sentences, none of them are anything an actual scientist would say, either because they are much too vague or just not remotely true. A couple that really got me in particular were: “Climate is an interdisciplinary subject requiring insights from many fields of study. Very few scholars have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines.” This made me laugh because 1. They argue earlier that too many different types of careers/people/scientists are sharing their views on global warming, and alongside that, they state that specialization is a bad thing, when in reality it’s much more effective to have someone be an expert in one field and collaborate with people who are experts in other fields. Also it is completely unrealistic to find just one person, let alone a large group of people, who are “masters” of more than one discipline. Another quote that made me confused was: “Extensive survey data show deep disagreement among scientists on scientific issues that must be resolved before the man-made global warming hypothesis can be validated.” What are they trying to say here? I’ve re-read it multiple times and I can’t seem to figure out if they’re arguing that all scientists disagree on global warming (which isn’t true), that all different opinions or differing hypotheses in the scientific community must be resolved before science is “ready” to discuss climate change (which makes no sense since it takes many tries and sometimes many different hypotheses to solve a problem), or that global warming can’t be true until 100% of all scientists in the world agree (Which will never happen considering who this novel chooses to refer to as “scientists).

<p>
The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” is extremely convincing, and deceiving. In chapter 2, the authors deceive the reader by stating “very few scholars in the field have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines” (“Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”). Most scientists’ goals are to have mastery of a discipline because mastering a discipline means that one has acquired expertise in that field, which would strengthen the validity of their conclusions. I would much rather accept a conclusion from an expert than from someone who may know about many fields, but only has surface-level knowledge. One statement that I do agree with is identifying climate as an interdisciplinary subject. Interdisciplinary subjects have the tendency to be more successful in finding conclusions because many researchers can collaborate on their research, discover potential inconsistencies, and work together to generate new conclusions that would be relevant to physics, biology, chemistry, etc. The ability to report on results that are relevant to more fields only strengthens the argument that climate change is occurring. 
 <br><br>

As Ken mentioned, teachers, elected officials, scientists, etc. are receiving free copies of this book. Most of these people are not experts in climate, or may not have mastery of a particular discipline so their opinion may be easily swayed since the skewed facts are convincing. The information is framed in such a way that the reader determines the conclusion cannot be false. Many of the arguments are of a distractive nature, where the statements of the argument do not lead to the conclusion they're trying to make you accept. As Ken pointed out in lecture, many of the sources are coming from biased foundations, and unless one does their own investigation into those foundations, they may not realize that they’re being paid to mislead people. It’s frustrating that teachers are being misled because it causes a ripple effect. The Heartland Institute misleads the teachers, the teachers mislead the children, and later, the children will mislead their children, and so on.

I 100% agree. It’s crazy to think the type of tactics the fossil fuel companies use to persuade people that climate change isn’t real. In Ken’s introduction video, he mentions how teachers are targeted by fossil fuel affiliates.  “why scientists are unsure about climate change” is sent out to confuse the 50% of teachers that actually talk about climate change in the classroom. When in reality 97% of scientists advocate for climate change.
<br><Br>
The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” makes it easy to believe that climate change is a hoax if that person was not too educated on the subject. The specificity makes you think that a lot of people are behind the denial of climate change. Of course this piece is biased and the statistics thrown in there are one-sided, but the it does seem convincing without the opposite value. For novels like these to be sent to teachers can end with dangerous results. If too many people get too comfortable in the current state of our planet, then the population will act when it’s even later.


<br><Hr>
This reminds me of the quote that says, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” Of course, one scientist won’t have complete mastery of every part that contributes to climate change. It’s too broad and expansive of a subject for one person to know all about. That’s why collective knowledge is so vital to not just climate change, but research as a whole. When two people cooperate, they’re able to communicate ideas, see different perspectives, and identify where they could’ve gone wrong. The fact that “very few scholars in the field have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines” should be comforting – it means that scientists are able to critique each other and give their own insight. 

<br><Br>

The fact that big businesses are backing “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” makes me fearful for the future. These corporations are wealthy from oil, coal, and natural gas industries, which allows them to be able to fund climate change denying entities, such as the Heartland Institute. With these funds, they’re able to spread their misleading information with great ease. As you mentioned, this initiates a cycle of misinformation and doubt about the reality and severity of our current situation. I’ll admit, the presentation of their “scientific findings” was convincing. But data can be skewed skillfully with the intent of having it prove your beliefs – we see what we want to see. I’m sure there are people who actually believe that climate change isn’t real, people who have been misled. However, the people running these corporations and institutes are concerned with making money. And they know the way to get what they want. It has definitely worked since many educators, students, and policymakers have fallen for their tactics. It feels difficult to argue against those who deny climate change sometimes.

Before the real chapters had even begun two sentences in the prologue caught my eye, “They claim the science is “settled.” But true science is never “settled,” and true scientists are always eager to ask and answer questions.” This resonated with me because I thought back to all the science classes I have taken in my life and realized that teachers always emphasized this concept, that science is never settled and theories can and should be constantly tested to be proven wrong. One can gain more support for a theory and generate stronger evidence but a theory is never an “unchanging truth”. This made me think even more about my stance on the climate crisis and how I have absorbed information in this course thus far. I’m always one to hit ‘A’ on my iClicker in lecture fully agreeing with the alarmist view. However, after doing a double take with these introductory sentences and after finishing the chapters I realized that maybe I need to consider other opinions, research, and support for the other side (climate change not being “real” or as much of a concern as our assignments have expressed.) By doing this, I can be better informed and have a greater idea of all the valid opinions surrounding an issue. 

<br><Br>

I liked that Ken had us read the Amazon comments on this book so we could see more opinions on the reading. I especially agreed with one of the comments that read, “This book was well organized and with valid points throughout but very dry in its prose, more textbook accounting of observations and conclusions than any sort of story.” While this was definitely to be expected as it is an informational reading, I wish there had been more life and spark in the writing itself rather than solely facts and arguments. 

<br><Br>

Finally, I found it interesting that not many K-12 teachers choose not to teach about climate change and the ones that do only spend a few hours doing so. Additionally, as Ken says, most present it as a two sided argument that scientists do not unanimously agree on. While this is not surprising because (especially in public education) opinions should be giving both sides, it is interesting that it is not brought up in more classrooms and for longer than an hour-long lesson.
<br><Br>


Overall, it was eye opening to see the voices of the “other side” of the argument. While I was not convinced that climate change is not real, I will definitely not jump to the alarmist view on every issue every time now--I want to consider all sides and information.

While I agree that scientific theory and discoveries are an ongoing process rather than definitive law, I think in this instance, the source of the information is paramount. You mentioned that considering the stance of the opposing side, you would be “…better informed and have a greater idea of all the valid opinions surrounding an issue”, though based on what we have learned thus far, would it truly be accurate to count the opinions, research, and support for the other side as ‘valid’?
<br><Br>

Much of the verbiage in the book are specifically designed to make readers question their stance; their goal is to instill a sense of confusion. As Ken states in his lecture videos this week, these propagandist sources are cleverly crafted and structured in a diplomatic way. Just as Wallace-Wells’ article is critiqued for being alarmist and further alienating those with an opposing view, the rant-like text that would be expected the small but growing group of climate deniers would naturally deter those who stand confidently on the side of science and fact. Thus, by choosing to present this misinformation to the public in an informative, well-written way, for free I might add, readers have an understandably more difficult time discerning fact from fiction.
<br><Br>

Unrelatedly, I am not surprised at all that teachers and children have been targeted by climate-change-denying institutions; the tobacco industry used a similar method through advertisements aimed at adolescents- making it seem cool to smoke- to create a new generation of smokers that would perpetuate their industry. It is a scary notion though; a new wave of climate deniers will keep the battle for climate action raging for far longer and will have greater consequences.


<br><hr>
I think you are correct in that the source of information is incredibly important in valuing a comment as credible or not. Again, I think that better widespread education would help this issue and could make the next generation less susceptible to carefully curated messages from politicians who are just trying to please constituents, etc. 

<br><Br>

While I was definitely not convinced into a climate denier state, I don’t think that ALL the sources in that reading or in others supporting that stance are from politician/ diplomatic backgrounds that are seeking to people please more than they want to present accurate data. 

<br><Br>

In regards to teaching about climate change—I am curious if it is the teachers themselves or their bosses/ education system that is out of their control that is preventing them from teaching about climate change or limiting the time they teach about it. I get that the tobacco industry created content for a target audience of young children to hook the next generation of smokers. However, I’m not sure that this generation of K-12 teachers are intending to create the next generation of climate-change deniers. Like I said above, I wonder who is in charge of telling teachers what they can teach about and for how long OR if it really is the teachers themselves that make this decision.

Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming
 <br><Br>

From reading the text, I finally get the idea that “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”. Before reading the text, I truly believe that most of the scientists would agree the fact of the continuing global warming at the time. But, out of my prediction, still some inviable hands control the results came from the scientists. Even though the outcome comes from authoritative group with relatively accurate data may be similar, the so-called common sense of the existence about climate crisis is not approved by the scientists anyway. Well, that’s why even some people do not believe the global warming. However, if those people that do not believe the climate change due to the different opinions from various scientists, it is pretty reasonable, is the fact nearly correct? The government tried to push those ideas about global warming away from the students, including the young generation, by k-12 teacher. Luckily, I consider the global warming as a true fact when I was small, and I can proudly say that my teachers did not try to tell me that all climate change was fake. The first environmental movie I have ever seen called An Inconvenient Truth, was introduced to me by my elementary school teacher. When you think back, the fundamental education really affected you deeply. The teachers in elementary probably could be one in your trust list as in younger age. The ideas brought by them exactly led the people thinking in that kind way. So, let the kids believe the climate crisis is fraud can effectively control the political situation when the kids grow up. What a nice trick.

After reading the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I started to think about the climate crisis in an out-of-box way. To be honest, I got offended by this writing. More importantly, this publication was kind of popular. It affected many many people in a negative way by denying the truth. The book tried to use scientific data to support the writer's point of view. However, as a researcher, myself, I could not agree with the ways the writer used to declare his opinion. He did not credit the data to any scientific research. At least, it is not specific. This makes me skeptical about the research they did. Any data without scientific research is just a number without any meaning.
 <br><Br>

Also, the writer tries to reinforce his idea again and again. It seems that he is just paraphrasing the main idea again and again. This is poorly written and a very bad way of persuasion. I believe most readers who have a decent amount of education would reject his idea completely. Of course, scientists will deny his idea as well, no exceptions. The book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is a very irresponsible way to the public. Spreading untrue speeches and words is destructive to the ongoing climate crisis. The climate is already getting worse, and there are still a small group of people keep trying to spread rumours. I do not understand the reason to do so?

I agree with the surface deceptive philosophy given by the author of "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming" which is to hold up free-thinking debate and argument as a means to find out truth amidst lies and ulterior motives. The problem with the book, however, is that it fails to follow it's own philosophy. When one commits themselves to debate and argument based purely on data and results and reality, they must throw aside all previously held convictions, agendas, biases, and motives and be completely ready to have their opinions and views shaped by the evidence. What is shown here, however, is the opposite. The book is constructed with the objective to manipulate data to fit a worldview, while trying to come off as the exact opposite. 
 <br><Br>


The data supporting anthropogenic climate change is quite literally staring at us in the face - extreme weather patterns previously unseen, increasingly frequent and increasingly intense natural disasters, rising global temperatures, destroyed ecosystems, etc. The effects are a hard truth. When the book attempts to brush those harsh realities aside in favor of throwing tweaked, twisted, dubious statistics at the reader with no context, it reveals an underlying dishonesty regarding integrity with data. The book doesn't use data as a means to argue, the book uses vast amounts of undecipherable, cherry-picked data as a means to confuse the reader into submission. The book attempts to show the reader that they couldn't possibly understand what is going on. If/when the reader accepts that they don't know what is going on due to the vast amount of auxiliary data, the book then brings in ethos from skeptic scientists or high-profile public figures, all of which with ulterior motives, to "show the reader the truth", saving them from the confusion brought about by the book's intentionally confusing statistics. It's a devious, underhanded strategy aiming to use data against the reader.

I completely agree with you! I also believe that one should be able to debate and show both sides of an argument in order to present the truth. It was interesting to read for once a piece written by climate change deniers and be able to see how they are trying to fool the public. Not only did they provide the public with false information, but they used only certain statistics in order to like you said, confuse the reader. They are misinforming the public and making it seem as though the reason for climate change is due to natural events rather than human-caused.
 <br><Br>

I found it upsetting how they began a mass mailing of this book to teachers. I thought of it as propaganda being disgusted in the form of “teaching material.” It's horrible to know that they sent this out to teachers from K-12 in order to confuse the students and teachers and provide them with misinformation. I was surprised to see that not a lot of teachers talk about or devote enough time to climate change in the classroom. This should be a subject that is talked about more and should be a way to educate future generations on this issue. When I was in high school, my teachers always found a way to talk about it and I wish it was something that was brought up more in other schools.
 <br><Br>

I also agree that the impacts of climate change are happening now and we could see this happening today all across the world. Not only are temperatures rising but a number of other catastrophes are taking happening due to human activity. The book fails to recognize the truth and is misinforming the public. Those who are not educated on the subject can easily be manipulated after reading this text.

The reading hold an opinion that people are overwhelming react to the climate change. Scientists in the reading thought climate change didn’t actually happen and human reaction didn’t really affect climate. I was disappointed after reading this article because there are still many people don’t believe that human action are actually causing seriously impact on climate change and it’s an urgency to take actions on climate crisis. However, those scientists and fossil fuel producers will delay the process of the actions taken by those who realize how severe the climate change is happening.

 <br><Br>

Also, it made me worry when i read that they mailed 300,000 unsolicited and free copies of the book to K-12 teachers since it may probably change the mind of those people who were not sure about anthropogenic climate change. They tried to pursue readers that 97% scientists are actually not all agree with the anthropogenic climate change by saying that the data and reports are not qualified since those scientist are not master in more than 1 subjects and climate is a complex phenomenon, and they also claimed that the study are incredible and being biased.
 <br><Br>
I’ve got angry when i get to know that fossil fuel company are making efforts to mislead people of anthropogenic climate change and pushing scientists to propagate that human actions have nothing deal with the climate crisis just for their own profit. I was curious about if those companies and scientists who hold disagreement of anthropogenic climate change are actually don’t think climate change is mostly caused by human or they just did this for profit when many disaster happened like wildfire and bad consequences are shown nowadays.
 <br><Br>


Whatever how people think about anthropogenic climate change, climate crisis is happening and it got worse over time.  So there’s no delay for taking actions.

After reading the first small portion of the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I had a better idea of where the disagreements occur as well as the potential factors that lead to these disagreements even among experts even though this book was written for a disinformation campaign. Namely the statistics for the scientific consensus on climate change. I’ve always thought the scientific community has agreed on the fact that climate change is caused anthropogenically. Factors such as publication bias, resume padding, and funding for researches towards an assumed cause showed me otherwise. There could definitely be natural causes of climate change but since the society has adopted the alarmist approach, these causes would not probably be explored. These factors do sound convincing despite the book is written to refute those so-called “alarmist” ideas. 
 <br><Br>


The reading provided a reasoning for the disagreement among scientists, and I think it is a really important point. Difference in majors and field lead to different perspectives and this is a very logical cause for the disagreement. In my ES1 class, I learned about how two different scientists with different perspective in different discipline viewed climate change differently. One viewed climate change as a stable mechanism by considering other periods of time when Earth has warmed significantly (such as the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum event) and so the modern climate change is just part of Earth’s natural process of adjusting temperature. The other compares short-term statistics of CO2 concentration using charts like the kneeling curve to show the significant increase of concentration over time. Although the perspectives of scientists vary, we should only consider the ones that focus on the present and benefit us as a whole in the future. I’ve always thought the statistics on climate change are concrete and could not really imagine how anyone can fall for the disinformation campaigns funded by corporates, but now I understand how they could be confusing the general public.

<p>
I’ve read this reading before. Both times, it didn’t change my view on climate change at all. Although my beliefs on the issue didn’t change, my emotions fluctuated wildly as I read the chapters. Last year, I read Merchants of Doubt, the book that inspired the movie. Although both pieces of writing completely differed, I felt similar emotions when reading them. 
  <br><Br>
Merchants of Doubt felt too ‘salty’ for me. I felt as if I was getting the same message pounded into me. It felt like I was reading a list of crimes or the more academic version of people being ‘flamed’ or ‘roasted’ online. I absolutely loved what Naomi Oreskes communicated to readers and viewers, but I still felt annoyed by her novel. I am in no way a climate denier, but I still found her novel irritating to read. 
 <br><Br>

 Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming was more than irritating to read. It was also laughable and entertaining. As I was reading, the Uno Reverse Card and ‘no u’ flashed through my mind. Even without researching or thinking much, I could note specific areas where they were hypocritical. As a result, the seemingly neutral or academic tone seemed much too overconfident and smug. Reading it made me feel irritated. 
 <br><Br>

 Merchants of Doubt and Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming have a similar purpose in my opinion. They convey why the other side has lied and is wrong. I agree with Merchants of Doubt’s content, and I don’t know whether to laugh or cry at Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, but reading both of them made me feel uncomfortable. The writers all seemed to be so right. I felt irritated when reading both of these books because of how righteous the writers of both books acted. They were telling us how we, the general public, had been lied to by the other despicable side. 
 <br><Br>

 The righteousness and fervent confidence bothered me because I, like many other people, don’t like being told I’m wrong. Actually, I don’t appreciate being told that the speaker is right so many times, even if it's necessary. Both of these readings annoyed me, though I really do appreciate Merchants of Doubt and quite like it, because the writers are so assured of their correctness overall.  I don’t like the purpose of these books: to point out the errors and hypocrisy of the other side because it just feels like an argument. People approach arguments in different ways, but I’d like to think that people don’t like arguing in general. People from one side will be angry at the other side, but neutral people might also be affected. Although it’s good to reveal the crimes of those in the wrong, I feel that these books might make people who are utterly confused or neutral not want to learn anymore and just stay out of the issue just from how messy the 'debate' has become. 
 <br><Br>

Although these novels attempt to seem academic and neutral and therefore correct, one is and one isn’t. But when people read them, who’s in the right or who’s the most logical isn’t always the most important thing. Emotions affect how people see messages. No one wants to feel wrong or that someone’s patronizing or ‘salty’ or bitter even if they’re right. The fact that climate change has sides and is an argument is terrible. We shouldn’t feel wrong or right, but see what’s actually happening. It was wrong for climate deniers to deceive the public, and I’m grateful that climate scientists and activists are revealing the deception, but the blackening of both sides has become rather distracting and aids the formation of divisions, sides, or tribes. Responding to climate deniers’ provocations lowers climate activists and scientists to their level, making activists and scientists even more vulnerable to attack. In order to better communicate to the general public, scientist and activists have sacrificed some moral high ground, making it possible for people to feel that they need to pick sides or that there are sides to the climate crisis.

After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I found it easy to believe that someone who was not too educated on the subject could be swayed. It provides many statistics, some which felt redundant, in an effort to barrage the reader with so much information that what is presented appears to be definitively true. However, having grown up learning about the climate crisis and global warming, I and many others were not compelled by the hand-wavy statistics and arguments. The book provided minimal data to back the presented statistics and claims. In addition, Ken went over in class that many of the sources are unreliable or misrepresented.
 <br><Br>
After watching Ken’s video on the reading, I remain surprised at how much effort fossil fuel interests put into discrediting climate change. It just is not understandable how the people behind these efforts, who already have more than enough money, care more about furthering their own greed rather than saving the planet for future generations of humanity. Their large excess of wealth will mean nothing once there is nowhere on the planet suitable for living.
 <br><Br>
Overall, I enjoyed taking a glimpse into the more concrete facets of climate change deniers. I have never really delved into learning about their side besides simply hearing that the weather is cold. It is interesting yet frustrating to read about their arguments and how they think.

 I also agree that in a way it is easy to see why some people are firm believers that climate change is not real or a danger to us. The article did a really good job at making it seem like people who believe in climate change have just been brainwashed into thinking so. It's different for our generation I feel because we have literally grown up seeing the effects of climate change, so it would be incredibly naive for us to claim that the climate isn't changing.

As I was reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," I began to think of it as a form of dangerous propaganda. The authors are spreading misinformation to the public, and more dangerously in k-12 schools. The material in the writing can be viewed as misinformed because it makes it seem as though anthropogenic climate change is a myth and rather natural events cause these changes in the climate. This is a very dangerous assumption as it takes away the blame from the industrialization, capitalism, and consumerism that is destroying our world. It also makes it seem as though there is much disagreement among scientists on the issue when in actuality almost all scientists will agree upon its existence and its primary causes as being anthropogenic. 
 <br><Br>

One thing I found ironic about Chapter 2 specifically was that it accused climate scientists of bias on behalf of careerism or political gain when in actuality it is climate change deniers that allow their bias and personal benefit to pervade the way they think and thus deny literal facts about climate change. A primary example of this is politicians who promote and vote on legislation that harms the environment and contributing to climate change, as well the corporate lobbyists who profit off of environmentally hazardous, money making practices. They only focus on their own personal biases and personal gain while completely neglecting the fate of the whole world. Ultimately, this reading frustrated me because of the vast misinformation it contained and because of how much people, especially powerful and wealthy people, support such a selfish and false ideology.

While reading Why Scientist Disagree About Climate Change I found it very difficult to take the arguments being made seriously for a number of reasons. The main reason being that I am a STEM major so it is a given that I trust and rely on science to make sense of the world. So while reading the text I found it ridiculous and somewhat boring how the text is criticizing and questioning the legitimacy of scientific research. My second reason plays into the first and it being that I found it painfully obvious how the text was trying to persuade and insist me (and the reader in general) into thinking that climate change is somehow a practical joke being played by an alarmist group of scientists. Although the text does make valid arguments that might resonate with people and make them doubt the severity or (to some degree) the reality of climate change, everything can be argued in opposition. One of the main efforts was to discredit the research conducted by historian Naomi Oreskes. The focus was to expose Professor Oreskes as a fraude who could not possible prove realistic analysis about climate change because she was not a scientist. I completely disagree with the statement. Firstly, historians are a credible source to learn about climate change from because they study the change over time. When explaining climate change in lamest terms it could be said that the climate crisis is the change of the climate over a span of decades. Therefore, historians can conduct research focused on climate change although the public would not associate climate change research with historians. In fact, historians have been a dominant influence on helping scientists establish the point in time at which climate change began in the Anthropocene age.
 <br><Br>

Although I was not persuaded at all by the text, I could see how some people might be. To begin with, the text is simple to read and its use of rhetorical devices does in fact make the argument sound valid. The facility is reading the text is an advantage it has over scientific papers because scientific papers are difficult to understand by someone who isn't an academic scholar; therefore people are limited in the sources they have access to. Furthermore, people may already doubt the reality of climate change and use the text as evidence to support their argument. And something worth noting which I was not aware of before and did not initially noticed when reading the text was that the intended audience are influential models in society such as K-12 teachers. The purpose of targeting teachers is to persuade them into teaching the young generation of children that climate change is not real. When Ken mention this on the video I was shocked and disgusted that climate change deniers went to get extents to perpetuate the education system in order to secure the fossil fuel companies for years to come.

After reading the sections of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I was both surprised and not surprised by how this book is structured. Surprised by how well and detailed it lays out the data, and not surprised when I learned that these information were given by groups who were funded by the fossil fuel industry. There are many controversial ideas that went completely the opposite of what I’ve been learning and seeing with my own eyes. If I was someone who haven’t learned the background of climate change, such as a child who still in first or second grade, I would probably believe what was stated in the book. 
 <br><Br>

To Summarize, this will become a serious problem, since our generation and the generations after us held the most power on making the steps, if we are misled by false information and public awareness decreased, the current situation will only become worse.

While reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I felt that the reader was presented with a piece that had a single purpose of disproving the consensus of climate change. Even though I personally believe the issue of climate change to be urgent and pressing, the detailed argument presented by the author was interesting to read and I could see how others would believe this to be true. However, I felt that the evidence used to support the argument that climate change is not as alarming of an issue was kind of stretched and may have been too specific. It seemed that too much effort was taken to find things that would provide a basis for the argument that climate change is not real. Furthermore, Ken's video about the extents fossil fuel interests take in order to steer away public attention from climate change was disappointing to hear about. I am not surprised by the information but it just made me realize the filtration of our information even though we feel like there are some "trusted" sources out there for public knowledge. I feel that this demonstrates the fact that we need to have more self-consciousness around our beliefs and not take any piece of information granted credibility based on the name of the source. I feel that self-experience and awareness of our surroundings should also be taken into account in addition to other sources. There are things we can notice and make conclusions about while being open-minded to other views and available sources.

The book is very scholarly and well-documented. It is really good to know what scientists are really saying on the issue of climate change. 
 <br><Br>

To my surprise, Heartland Institute mailed out free, unsolicited copies to K-12 teachers in the United States, saying that climate change is not a problem. Children are the future of our society and potential helpers to stop climate change. Their actions endanger human’s future indirectly.
 <br><Br>

Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree that climate change is real, man-made and dangerous. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), more than half of observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcing together. Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system. However, some scientists disagree about the environmental impacts of the combustion of fossil fuels on the global climate and climate change is not caused by human activities.
 <br><Br>

The book provides audiences with many arguments. Part of scientists are too worried about climate change and instill fear. But some of them are too carefree. As far as I am concerned, scientists are supposed to motivate and inform people more facts. We should be optimistic and passionate to face the climate change. More importantly, we should do something from now on to change our situation.

If I had not known any better, I easily could've been persuaded by the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming." The book is written very well and smoothly provides information about the climate crisis. It does a very successful job in portraying information and data in a way that fits the agenda of climate deniers. The authors quote and source all the data they talk about. They heavily use numbers as proof since it's not easy for a reader to disprove. In short, this book seems legit. Somebody -- like a teacher, for example -- who may not be completely informed on the climate crisis could easily buy into the stuff the authors are saying, and therefore pass it down onto their students. It's destructive and sadly, it's effective. 
 <br><Br>

What I found the most staggering was what Ken said in the video -- that almost 100% of climate denial books are funded by conservative think tanks and fossil fuel interests. It makes me feel that these authors actually don't believe in what they say; rather, it makes me feel like they are in it for the capital that these fossil fuel interests are willingly to pay. I also find it interesting how a lot of these think-tanks, such as the Heartland Institute, have argued in favor of large industries on topics like second-hand smoke before. Again, this shows that these institutes are run off of the money of wealthy industries.
 <br><Br>

It angers me that these types of books even exist. The people who write these MUST know the effects that they will have on the youth and therefore the Earth, yet they still do it. The only thing we can do to combat tactics like this is to continue to act and spread the word about anthropogenic climate change. The more people know the truth, the less they will buy into skewed statistics and false ideas.

It's almost baffling how much effort is put in for this book, and the money that was spent giving away the book to people of influence--and for what? As you say, the authors are likely in it for capital, not because it's what they truly believe after looking at the science. Keeping the public confused about climate change means less regulations on them, so they can keep making money. What's hardest for me to believe, though, is how much effort is put into doing this despite how insignificant that money will be. It's not gonna matter how much extra money these companies can acquire by prolonging action against climate change, because climate change is going to cost EVERYONE. Already, we've had the most expensive natural disasters occur as a result of climate change. Statistically, GDP is declining with rise in average temperature. Climate change is expensive, and by prolonging the time it takes to fight it, we're simply increasing the price of it more and more. It's perplexing that these groups are selfishly dooming our home and our future for something that will be so futile.

Having read the article and then watching Ken's video I was able to agree with the points he was making. Too many people are confused about climate change including teachers who are the ones educating the next generation. However, the fault does not lie on the teacher but to the corporate companies like the Heartland institute that are misinforming the public. Sending 300,000 copies of their book to teachers to confuse and mislead. The book was well written and was specifically designed to discredit the climate change crisis and to confuse people. They did it once with second-hand smoking and are now trying to do it with climate change. With companies spending hundreds and thousands of dollars on propaganda each year to mislead and make people question climate change. The thing that shocked me the most was that a part of the government are also on board with confusing and telling the students that climate change isn't real. States like Montana are filling student's heads with information that discredits climate change. They are using their power and money to achieve their agenda of confusing people about climate change so that they could just continue on selling fossil fuels and carbon-based products. What they are doing is horrible and with climate change becoming an alarming issue the information needs to be simple. That it is here and we need to do something before it's too late. There's already evidence that supports that climate change is here but all of that aside. We need to take action, the events that are happening like the wildfires, hurricanes, and tornados appear in places that they usually don't speak for itself. People just need to understand that its time to act before its too late.

I completely agree with you, the epidemic of false information being spread is the main damager for the fight against climate change. Think tanks such as the Heartland Institute are likely sending out misinformation in mass to confuse the public and even more dangerously teachers on purpose. Teachers really are the heart of this nation. They bring up the youth and often times have a giant influence on how they grow into an adult. For instance, in my case, my sixth-grade teacher was monumental to my growth as a scholar. Growing up in a low-income household, I simply didn't know whether college would be the way for me, but due to her backing and her personal ideals I ended up here and I am extremely grateful for it. Thus, for a combined 80% of teachers or near that number to either teach climate change as perhaps a proponent of natural causes or not teach at all is not only worrisome it's absolutely terrifying. Climate change will likely be the most important issue of their generation yet they are not being exposed to the dangers and possibility that comes along with that issue. And another thing that Raul pointed out that I also noticed was the fact that Montana,  is attempting to make it mandatory that misinformation about climate change is spread and taught to primary school children. This is really outrageous in every shape and form but the most dangerous part about everything that was covered in the article and introductory video is the fact that the article was actually compelling. While I obviously wasn't swayed sufficiently if at all by the ideas that the article presented, I could reasonably imagine non-educated or critics easily being persuaded into believing this bunch of capitalistic lies that only serve a purpose to continue the wealth gap and continue the riches of those in the fossil fuel business.
 <br><hr>
 I too agree with you. I especially resonate with what you said about growing up in a low income household where topics such as climate change just aren’t discussed at all. Most of what I myself learned about the climate crisis has been through this class and last quarter’s English 22 class. The spread of misinformation cannot be attributed to simple ignorance, such that as Raul wrote, it is well written and well calculated. When it comes to the general public, I believe that most people who undermine scientific findings regarding the climate crisis are simply afraid of the truth and prefer to live in ignorant bliss. However, when think tanks like the Heartland Institute push climate change skepticism, there are deeper reasons at play. Unfortunately, money and power comes before genuine care for the planet and it’s people for most big corporate companies. The climate crisis is not a political or economic issue, yet it often finds itself treated as one. Like Raul said, it is time for the public to take action and realize how high the stakes really are. This will only be accomplished by pulling our support of money hungry companies.

Going into the reading from “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I wondered how they would try to convince me otherwise that man-made climate change is not real. The book, although well written, mostly targeted the issues with studies that state “97% of scientists believe in climate change.” I understand that the way these scholars did their research and surveys was not accurate and they should have used better research techniques, but I do not agree with what they were trying to get at. They did not take a radical stance on climate change and try to avidly deter me from believing in climate change. 
 <br><Br>
 One thing that really bothered me once I read the book description and watching Ken’s video, is that they distribute their book to unsolicited school teachers. It is disturbing that this is the only way that they could get their information across as well as knowing that the Heartland Institute also made their book into a free online pdf so others could get access to the book. Although they say that they are a non-profit organization, I still cannot get over that they are funded by fossil-fuel companies and that is the prime motivation for their writing. Reading this piece and the Amazon comments made me really worried that people believe this and that they don’t believe in climate change. I understand why some people would believe it and be another denier of climate change, but I just hope that not everyone buys into it and reads further about the issue and how, if we don’t act fast, we won’t be able to stop the doom that awaits us.

I absolutely agree with everything you said here. I really like that you brought up the Heartland Institute and the accessibility that they aimed for this book to have to everyone. It’s alarming and honestly extremely manipulative to be aiming this argument (the book) not really for the teachers who received it, but for the audience that those teachers have - children who trust them. 
 <br><Br>


     Aside from those concerning actions though, I think from an analytical standpoint this reading is filled with some pretty impressive rhetoric techniques. If I were still in high school in AP Lang having to analyze this- I could have probably written a book on all the different rhetorical devices here and their intended effect on the reader. Right off the bat one of the first things I noticed was how the book immediately addresses the reader’s hesitancy towards it - that it is “funded by the fossil fuel industry to “sow doubt” or otherwise emphasize the absence of certainty on key aspects of the debate.” The fact that it doesn’t skip over this controversy, but head on addresses it, is intended to show the reader that the following information in the piece is supposed to be strong enough to disprove these doubts. This blunt approach is a pretty strong technique and shows that the author knows what they’re up against and for me as a reader was a surprisingly effective approach. 
 <br><Br>


     If I didn’t know as much as I did about climate change, or didn’t have the strong passion and belief in it that I do, I honestly think this book is pretty effective. Like you said, that can be seen in the Amazon comments on it. Which are pretty unnerving. If someone wanting to educate themselves stumbled upon this book first, I have no doubt their entire approach to climate change, no matter what they heard there on after, would be tainted and filled with doubt. That is exactly the intent of this piece, and it’s pretty terrifying how such a minority of climate denial-ists can have such a loud voice.

After having read the first three chapeters of this book I was utterly disgiusted. The lies and twisted retoric is just as destrective as relesing CO2 into the atmosphere. The public deserves to know the truth about the climate crisis at hand and therefore fake facts and just plain defaming the the hardwork of scientists that have been made in order to save and better humanity. The amount that conservitives have to lie inorder to help keep their money. From their lies and cheating to gain votes in the 2016 election to this. They handicap the public’s to work tyo live more sustainlby. Also, I assume that there are people that are simply too lazy to switch their lifestyle and so conservitive think tanks like this serve asd enablers so they don’t have to be inconvinced by the change to a sustaible lifestyle. 
 <br><Br>
Also after having read the amazon comments as I expected so mamy people are by the trash that they are being fed by these conservitve think tanks. However, the most frightening to me is the what Ken pointed out in his video introduction about the amount of teachers who teach the wrong idea to our youth. As Ken has previuosly said the youth are the leaders of this movement and when the most credibke peroson concering education in a childs mind, their school teachers, fail to them the truth we are in big trouble.

After reading the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I feel that angry that most the scientist still not think that it is important to protect our environment. They still think this is not an important issue us human being. Or I was thinking that Ken wants to give us the turning point this course that climate crisis is coming but it's not that serious as it said is. It's just those smart people came up an idea, if the new over spread the environmental issue, the people would believe it and do something rather than not doing anything. The climate is not that bad. After I realized that this is not a truth. Why? the tsunami of the Japan, the big fire of the Australia, the flu of the United States. And Ken stated over and over again that the importance of the education. The fossil fuel company fund the schools and books, so the teachers will teach their students that the global warming is not a big problem. The most trustworthy people for kids.And the kids would go back home and tell it to their parents. It benefits the fossil fuel company the most. That's why some companies start to put money in the educations, because it can change next generation's thoughts.

I really enjoyed this book and this video. It is not because I really enjoyed the contexts in the book but the idea and methods how people try to tell public that global warming is false. In this issue of global warming, it is now like a battle between two groups of people. People care about the environment vs people are benefit from the industry that hurt environment. It is very true that education for the younger is very important because 20 or 30 years later, they are the people who will be the mainstream. It is easier to "brain wash " them when they are young. And obviously, people from gas, coal and other fossil fuel industry realized it too. The book " Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" uses a false title intentionally that it brings an idea in at the first step. Nobody talks about it, nothing prove it, but they just assume it. It is a very typical way when people try to persuasive readers.  When professors tell me almost all books or articles that talk about "the global warming is false" are funded by the gas industry, I found it ironic. Imaging cigarettes company tell public smoking has no damage to lungs, car companies suggest everyone needs to change a new car for their safety or all students in the math class give themselves an A in the final. Don't you find these things funny? Ironically, on the case of global warming, people start to believe it. I think this book teaches me a lesson that when we face new information, we need to try to question it and testify it. It is the way to find out the truth,

<p>
I feel like this book was, more than anything, written to confuse its readers about whether or not climate change is occurring and/or whether its occurrence is an issue. 
 <br><Br>

The first indicator that this book was aiming to do just that  was the fact that the people who formatted this book did so in such a way that, to a person simply skimming through, it would seem to be a proper book with dependable information (not to judge a book by its cover but sometimes, as in this case, one might incorrectly assume that the content of this book is relying on facts). This book is, in fact, not quite relying on facts (or, should we say, “dependable information”). It is really only using the information which is provided by the Heartland Institute, which shows that this information can’t be 100% truthful since, if its coming from one source, it must have some sort of bias.
 <br><Br>

The second indicator that this book was written in order to confuse people is the way in which the book is written. Its use of words/phrases that are sometimes fairly colloquial, such as “Why bother?” or “out of touch” bring a sense of shared understanding of the topic at hand in the reader while the use of complex words, such as “imperceptible”, makes the book seem more intellectual and therefore more trustworthy in the reader’s eyes. These techniques are done in order to try to persuade the reader to entertain the idea that climate isn’t real and/or isn’t a bad thing. And tactics like these often work on people who have not been exposed to such writings before.

This book was definitely very deceitful. 
 <br><Br>

“The number of scientists actually knowledgeable about this aspect of the debate [climate change] may be fewer than 100 in the world. Several are prominent skeptics (John Christy, Richard Lindzen, Patrick Michaels, and Roy Spencer, to name only four) and many others may be.”
 <br><Br>

So what I’m hearing is that the statement that 97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is man-made is a myth? But the evidence against that is that 4% of climate experts, possibly more, are in agreeance that it’s a myth, leaving the other 96%, possibly less, to believe it’s not? I don’t know, it seems like the numbers line up against the myth theory. 
 <br><Br>

I also find it extremely ironic that this book tries to discredit the scientific research by claiming bias through “careerism, grant-seeking, political views, and confirmation bias” as if denying climate change has also not turned into a political view, as if fossil fuel companies don’t pay big money to have these ideas pushed, and as if people reading this don’t do it to fuel their own confirmation bias so they can say “No, my ideas are correct and I don’t need to change, it is everyone else that is wrong.”
 <br><Br>

I do believe that peer reviewing and trying to disprove a theory are very important aspects of the scientific method, so I believe there is some good in what is being talked here. However, the current circumstances point towards the need of immediate action, and the deniers are doing more harm than good when it comes to what they are doing, especially when their main argument boils down to “we can’t know for sure”

In the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", funded by Heartland, the consensus on climate change was "debunked". In this text their goal is to create doubt in the scientific consensus that Climate change is in fact real and grave consequences will result. A lot of rhetoric and fallacy is used in order to prove their claim that Climate change is too uncertain in order to be deemed significant. Their focus of attack being the IPCC, who is a strong advocate in climate change being real and has been greatly impacted through anthropological means. By doing this they also discredit other bodies of work that helped create the statistic that 97% of scientists have come the agreement that climate change is real-including works by Oreskes, Zimmerman, Dorman, and Anderegg. The NICPP report discredits the method in which the researchers got their findings in order to discredit the belief that climate change is in fact real.

 <br><Br>

What I found extremely disturbing was that the book was released in such a desperate manner. The younger generations are our only hope in order to combat the already looming consequences of climate change, yet Heartland wants to blind them. 300,000 copies were mailed to teachers in order to be relayed to their students in hopes to convince them that climate change is not a danger to them or the planet. As stated in the lecture this had the potential to impact 10 million children! This behavior is sickening. 

 <br><Br>

The actual paper itself is extremely hypocritical. The exact behavior that they were criticizing the IPPC for doing is being mirrored by them. For example the claims that because the topic of climate change is not in complete consensus it is considered insignificant. If this is the case then wouldn't their argument also be considered invalid? They accuse of the IPCC being funded by the government and that their published work is biased due to this. This book is funded by a fossil fuel company, but apparently this holds no weight to their accusations. This book is only good for rhetoric, not for any factual information

We have to take into consideration who actually published the book Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming. Who is Heartland Institute and what are they actually known for? The Heartland Institute has been promoting the denial of the climate crisis and has received funds from ExxonMobile for specifically that reason. The document leaks that came from the Heartland Institute in 2012 revealed that they received help from the Koch foundation to cast doubt over the validity of scientific findings that explain the long term effects that fossil fuels have on the planet. The Koch family is not leading the fight to bring more awareness to the climate crisis, they are known as a big oil company and they spend as much money as necessary to protect their company. 
 <br><Br>


Therefore, when reading this book, which tries to discredit scientists and other members of the academic community, it is important to remember that the Heartland Institute is not an adequate group to be speaking on the matter of climate change because they do not provide their own research, but instead try to dismantle the work of others to prove a point that is not correct. Considering how well this book was presented and how many people believe it’s a well written book, it's scary to consider how many people who actually received this book believed its content to be factually correct.

This week’s reading focus is particularly interesting as it emphasizes the importance of education in the climate crisis. In my initial biased perspective of climate change deniers, I have always pictured a group of people that are frantic and slightly out of it (seem sort of crazy), similar to those a part of the Flat Earth organizations. Therefore, seeing such a well, and carefully crafted work as Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming was a real eye opener. They know what they are doing and they are good at it. It is incredible to think about how precise they are in delivering their message through education of not just any adults, but teachers who lead a movement of children that learn from them. I say this as these climate deniers know enough to target millions of children at a time through these subtle indirect ways, but of much impact for our future. To give these books out for free to spread the distribution is quite terrifying as well, seeing how the mass public will easily get their hands on these texts, and with such carefully made studies to somehow bend and misinform facts, this is a hard thing for many commoners with little education on certain subjects, to discern from other arguments. Which is true? Which is false?
 <br><Br>

Even as I read this text, I feel points of skepticism against whether there really is a 97% consensus amongst scientists that the climate change is human caused. Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming uses surveys and studies to back up their thoughts, which is unlike some unbelievable claims from people that just say, “It’s just like that.” The fact that they can say that these claims of scientific consensus are false due to flawed surveys, sounds so convincing within the text. It is usually when I read about flawed surveys from climate crisis deniers that these sorts of wordings come about, but to hear it from the other side, makes me take a step back to really zone in on their argument. As we learned in Communication Research Methods, it is incredibly important in any science and in any research that we are carefully evaluating their data, in order to see the holes in data to avoid manipulation of findings or wrong interpretations or even misreported data. With so many references embedded into Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, it adds a good amount of credibility in their findings. One would need to go through their sources and take a long time to fact check everything along with their reasoning. Everything is written in an easy to read way and their argument is presented very well. It makes everything I have thought before questionable to a degree where I need to compare data separately in order to be certain. This seems to work to their advantage, which is scary to have given so much power to climate change deniers who are trying to almost brainwash our next generation of kids and us as a whole, to fall into the trap of thinking that we are not a part of the climate crisis issue. This makes me appreciate ENGL 23 as a course even more as we have put together an active body of students with a lecturer to guide us in discussions, promoting topics of inquiry and such, encouraging us to take action now about the climate crisis. A course like this, indeed, should be a requirement to further our redirection of education in the right direction of urgency.

I too had the same bias as Linda in terms of the perspectives of climate change deniers as I questioned the basis of their arguments. “Why scientists disagree about global warming” deliberately scrutinizes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) claim on the consensus among scientists regarding anthropogenic climate change. It is almost frightening to consider the fact that climate deniers are dynamic; they are taking active roles in government, science, and education to publicize their views. As a result, their influence is present in our own households, as I have encountered discrepancies on the climate crisis within my own family and, quite alarmingly, in our schools. 
 <br><Br>

I would say that this book and Ken’s introduction are a sort of wake-up call for me. We consider education to be one of the first steps to actively combat the climate crisis, but I had not considered that education can also be a tool for climate deniers, evident in the free distribution of the book to teachers alone. For this reason, it is important, as Linda points out, to educate and gain the support of fellow students and the youngest of our generation.

I appreciate how clearly you were able to capture the thoughts I had formulated into words, especially in regards to not considering that education works both ways, not just to actively combat the climate crisis, but by some, education is used as a tool for climate deniers. These active bodies are truly as you say, dynamic, and are immersing themselves into our government and education, which is a dangerous step into spreading their views, as they continue to teach it as the “right” way. What makes this whole situation worse is that it is all deliberate, and even with all the facts lining up to go against climate deniers, they still find ways to manipulate data and try their hardest to disprove things that could potentially destroy any hope for a future.

I hate how genius the fossil fuel industries are for constructing such a well-written article that understands its opposition enough to know just which holes to poke in the climate crisis argument. Instead of blatantly rambling about their biases, the article manipulates logic to hide their true agenda. It’s really sad how even some strong climate crisis activists questioned their beliefs based on the meticulously calculated arguments made in the article. The writers clearly knew their advantages: majority of the world’s population aren’t professionally versed in the field of science, so they made sure to amplify their ethos by presenting seemingly objective data, and included citations, that allowed them to create just enough doubt to sway their intended audience a centimeter more towards the side of climate deniers. 
 <br><Br>
Furthermore, it’s absolutely disgusting how kids are being taught articles like “Why Scientists Disagree on Climate Change.” The sponsors truly know how to fight their battle, targeting the next generation when they are at the age where they absorb knowledge like a sponge.

When I was first reading this I believed it was another paper backing climate change and how people need to change, but later on I realized this to be a paper in support of the fossil fuel industry as it was denying climate change. It was a very compelling argument with a lot of sources which makes the paper look very legitimate. As a person who didn’t know too much about the climate crisis before coming to UCSB, I honestly may have taken this in willingly. I still would’ve believed in climate change of course, but probably not to the degree I do currently. This paper being released to many teachers and educators is a very serious problem as it most likely really affected how some kids see this crisis. I think that this also addresses a serious problem in America: people being gullible. Many people will see stuff in the media or read an article and immediately take it to heart without doing any research for themselves, and therefore become a misinformed individual spreading fake facts. This is an epidemic in this country that needs to be resolved as many people are not well informed and are causing more harm because of it. Another example besides the climate crisis would be vaccinations being harmful or even that guns are a good thing because they help protect innocent people. These ideas can be very persuasive with the wrong information and in the right format, but in reality these ideas are just blatantly wrong.

I've never been more angry reading a document.The authors of "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" are lying through their teeth for money. It was difficult reading this after attending the Friday lecture. Nearly every piece of evidence used in support of their argument is fabricated or heavily modified by the same people writing. This article is nothing more than a culmination of lies fabricated by the fossil fuel industry in an attempt to brainwash the youth and influencers of America. They also rely very heavily on ethos in an attempt to discredit authors who are pro-climate. There was an obscene amount of name-calling. They label their opposition as "socialists", "liberals" and "wacky bloggers" to paint believers in climate change as untrustworthy idiots. These authors also cannot decide whether climate change isn't happening or whether a general heating of the globe just isn't harmful. These people know they're lying and are just preparing for when each of their points get shot down. They also spent a great deal of effort to make themselves seem credible and honest. They even specifically state that they were supported by donations from individuals and not multi-billion dollar fossil fuel businesses. Then how were you able to distribute thousands of copies for free? No individual cares enough about denying climate change to spend that much unless they sought monetary gain. This scale of misinformation is one of the most tragic events of the decade. I hope these teachers and politicians looked under the hood of this paper to discover how fraudulent and biased it is. If we fail to prevent the climate crisis, greed will be the reason.

I found this book to be an interesting approach to the climate change discussion. The work done here is best described as carefully crafted and misleadingly calculating; the reader can’t help but leave with trust issues. The overall strategy used to break down the validity of the climate crisis is to divide scientists against each other, therefore crumpling their credibilities. Research from Oreskes, Doran, Verheggen, and more are all picked apart using quality methods, but are these articles widely agreed upon as quality representations of climate criss education, or were they chosen because they were easy to debunk? Additionally, the petty connotations and persistence to dismiss these scientists reminds me of petty mind games of teens. Although the methods used (presenting the factors of debunk, differences in productivity of climate alarmists and deniers) are sturdy strategies, the end goal of this book is to produce a skewed perception of climate crisis. The authors are quick to devalue the work of others, yet fail to explain exactly how they know that the editors of Oreskes’ essay never reviewed her database or how they knew Verheggen was embarrassed of his data findings. To me, they seem to be jumping to conclusions, not searching for the truth, but searching for the ways that climate alarmists are wrong. A lot of the scientists’ work presented here is purely logical; I think a reason why so many of them never explicitly conclude that climate change is a serious problem is that they want the reader to draw their own conclusion using their own mind. The authors of this book do the exact opposite, shoving skewed facts and pathos down the readers throats to distract from the big business and political agenda funding the climate denier side.  To address climate change would mean serious pain for fossil fuel depending companies and nations, their only hope of preventing this is to spread lies and corrupt future generations. This crisis reads like the children’s movie “Coraline”, only this time there’s no guaranteed happy ending.

I just find it ridiculous that there are still disbelievers of climate change when there is evidence of it everywhere. Every decade we are seeing hotter temperatures. Wildfires are occurring at a higher rate and there are more damaging hurricanes. I don’t understand why people think scientists would lie about human-caused climate change. What do they gain out of telling us that we are destroying the world? Climate scientists are simpling trying to stop us from killing off our species and every other species on the planet. 
 <br><Br>
I am disgusted with the Heartland Institute. Not only are they trying to get people to believe that climate change is a hoax, but in the past, they tried to do the same thing with secondhand smoke. They attempted to disprove the health risks surrounding secondhand smoke. I am also disgusted by the fact that they gave the book away from free to schools. Kids will usually be influenced by whatever their teachers tell them, so if teachers are explaining the material in this book the students will most likely believe it. The younger generations will be the ones who have to deal with the effects of climate change. They need to be aware of what is happening to our planet and need to be informed of possible ways they can help. 
 <br><Br>
The Heartland Institute also believes that climate change could be beneficial. Which makes no sense. How would warmer weather, sea-level rise, more natural disasters, and so much more be beneficial? The Heartland Institute also believes that if we combat climate change we will be destroying the economy which is probably one of the worst arguments. If we do nothing it will cost way more money than if we act ahead of time. It will cost billions of dollars to fix all of the damages climate change will cause.

The book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" was very well written and after reading it I can see why it could be very effective in generating doubt about climate change consensus. One of their very convincing arguments was that neutral scientists who are skeptical of climate change are grouped together with those who were funded by the fossil fuel industry, and as a result this defames scientists who question the consensus that “97% of scientists” state global warming is man-made and oversimplifies the debate into two groups. As we can see the book brings up easily understood and oversimplified points that can make the reader feel doubtful if they do not read carefully. The NIPCC strategy was to simply debase the arguments presented by climate scientists instead of providing new information that refutes those arguments. They attack the 97% consensus statistic without actually providing proof for their arguments against it. This is an effective strategy because the numbers/statistics/articles are already there for them to attack, there is no need for them to generate anything themselves.

In all honesty, the book's arguments are meticulous and well-written. The rhetoric used could easily sway people who know little to nothing about climate change. These arguments are constructed to use anything said by climate change believers, activists, or alarmist and twist them so that it will make you examine your own beliefs.

 <br><Br>

 I find it pointless to try to rebut any of the arguments made in the book but it looks to me that these deniers are just baby boomers who think they are exempt from responsibility. Maybe this is because their time will come in about 20 or so years and if they are wrong about their denial, they won't have to deal with the consequences anyway. Why would they believe in anything that will inconvenience their comfortability? I do enjoy reading the denier's opinion, even if their opinion is...wrong. I admit it took me awhile to "appreciate" the detail  put into this book because at first it seemed as if the author was only giving criticism to the opposing view but not exactly talking about the actual scientists that do not believe in the climate crisis.
 <br><Br>


I also want to mention how easy the authors demonize the phrase "global warming" (the Trump rally clips keeps replaying in my mind). Deniers use this phrase religiously to makes the climate crisis seem shallow and...stupid. And it is even more alarming that they are giving this rhetoric to children and teachers--who are shaping the future world.

I definitely agree that the book's arguments are meticulous and well-written, in order to help pursue the reader of a specific side. It demonstrates that those uneducated in the subject are easily drawn to facts that seem to fit their perspective if given the idea that they might be credible.

In the book “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming,” the writer intends to persuade the reader that the environmental issue is not mainly caused by the human activities. It introduces a lot of scientific evidence. This reading informs us the totally different ideas we learned in the class and try to mislead us the issue is not that kind of serious. 
 <br><Br>

After I watch the video, I am surprised that only 30 to 45 percent of middle or high school teacher selected the correct answer even through there is 97 percent of scientists believes in anthropogenic climate change. I know the important role of education and it is the most crucial factor to solve the public confusing about the climate change. It is like what we learn from our parents, can be never changed over time and remember deeply in the mind. If these teachers don’t do not get the whole picture and mislead by those books and the power behind the books. How can we teach the kids with the right thing?

I totally agree with your point on the importance of education on solving this issue of anthropogenic climate change. Spreading awareness on the devastating effects of climate change to younger generations is critical so that we stop this perpetual cycle of environmental neglect and exploitation. Like you, I was surprised by this the percentages of middle and high school teachers that did not get this answer right despite the fact there is a general consensus (97%) within the scientific on this issue. Unfortunately, after reading this book, I was able to understand this surprising statistic and understand why it was happening.  
 <br><Br>


It gets me angry that fossil fuel interests are adopting methods that are targeting our youth, and spreading doubt on an issue that should be common knowledge. Intentionally planting those seeds of skepticism on kids when they are at an age where they are starting to become their own person and develop their own thoughts, ideas, and opinions is a wicked thing to do. While the book is only sent to the teachers of classes K-12, teachers are the ones that students look for answers from. If teachers are being misinformed and giving out misinformation to their students, then who is telling these students the actual truth, and who will they believe more if they hear evidence to the contrary? Fossil fuel companies are attacking our education system and our children and it saddens me to see them taking such extreme measures to cast doubt on climate change.

If I wasn't so fortunately educated on the topic of climate change, my views on the climate crisis would have been swayed. 
 <br><Br>

The Heartland Institute does a good job in the writing of this book. When read quickly without deep thought, the argument for the climate crisis can seem slightly unreasonable. However, because I am reading with my own bias and skepticism, I was able to see past their poorly sourced arguments. 
 <br><Br>

Many of the criticisms that the authors had of the environmentalists could be just as quickly applied to the deniers themselves. With the story of the blind men touching the elephant, the deniers argue that these scientists don't know what they're seeing exactly because they aren't looking for the other picture. But couldn't this exact argument be made against the deniers as well? 
 <br><Br>

The deniers didn't have substance; they didn't have numbers and facts and evidence to back up their arguments. They simply attacked the other side based off of little logic using several fallacies. It was honestly quite frustrating to read because of this. When learning about the consequences of climate change, there are statistics, data, real life evidence that we've experienced to back up the arguments. The arguments of the deniers are weak, I wonder how long this group can keep up their act of ignorance. 
 <br><Br>

 The deniability of climate change at this point has become absurd. It's right under all of our noses; the climate scientists aren't the blind men feeling an elephant, but it is the deniers who are the ones who are refusing to open their eyes.

Using only one phrase to describe this book: “psychological manipulation”. The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” targets people’s sympathy with minority groups. It has been a cliche that we need to pay more respect to the minorities than the majority because they are fragile. Regarding the debate over global warming, the climate deniers are of no doubt representing a tiny amount of the academia. Therefore, instead of being opposed by the public, they actually are in a rather safe moral position to fight climate scientists. It is really sad to see an absolute fact is being challenged over and over again. 

 <br><Br>

This book reminds me of a controversy UK documentary: “The Great Global Warming Swindle”, where a bunch of “scientists” sitting down talking anthropogenic global warming is not happening In their principal, similarly, if there is an outlier in your data, your model doesn’t work. All climate deniers love to pick holes. They just ignore the main body of statistics and focus on abnormal cases. It seems like they have thousands of circumstantial cases that disapprove of global warming. However, there exist tons of millions of thousands of cases in favor of global warming that they never talk about. Their strategies are rather childish.

I absolutely agree. These "third party" or "marginalized" groups always come in trying to be the voice of reason and protect everyone. These groups see any move towards regulation or change as a threat to freedom and paint it as such for the common public. It is no wonder people get confused when its framed this way. The average person is not going to be fact checking or research the persuasive bs that these people are spewing, they are not going to follow the money, and they certainly are not going to know the difference between the legitimacy of the IPCC report vs the NIPCC report because they both look the same.

The fact that copies of these were given to influential political figures and common public is sickening, and since the issue revolves around climate change I think it is criminal. I have no idea how any of these people can sleep at night when their work is essentially a direct contributor towards inaction on climate change and the suffering of millions of humans and billions of other animals. It is delusional that people with no credentials or credentials that are "science related" can be touted as experts on such a complex issue. The fact that they play the victim is the cherry on top. Claiming that "big science" has has tried to silence them and such an effort was made to expose the truth. These people are not whistle blowers, and they are certainly not heroes. If you ask me they are criminals that need to be justly punished or they at least need to get out of the way so we can properly address the climate crisis.

I feel like this comment was put together very well and describes exactly how I feel after I read "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming". It is mind boggling to me that corporations are putting such extraneous amounts of effort to deny the truth about what's going on with climate change. These people went to the extent to target teachers to get to children to influence them to deny the true facts about climate change! It is truly amazing how far people will go to make money regardless of who or what they are harming.

<br><Hr>

I agree with this comment. I find it funny how ignorant some people are of certain facts and statistics that clearly show that the climate crisis is real. Some choose to ignore these facts and instead try to find ways around believing the climate crisis is happening. Regardless of what one believes, the climate crisis is a real problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Climate deniers have the right to their own opinion, but should not go out of their way to disprove the efforts towards fixing the climate crisis. We need to start gathering big support groups and making plans to decrease the affects of increasing temperature and increased CO2 in the atmosphere. There are few climate deniers in society, meaning most of everyone else will believe in the cause. The problem is a lot of people are unaware of the climate crisis that is currently happening. We need to bring awareness to this problem and show everyone the severity. This will be a huge wake up call to many and might even sway a few climate deniers to the other side.

In the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I was totally shocked by the fact which said that there are still a lot of people who hold the opinion that climate change or global warming isn’t happening in our life. The author of this book claims some main reasons why they think the idea that “all scientists” are advocating is wrong- scientists’ conflict between each other; failure in providing the real, great and appropriate guidance; and the bias. At first, I read this book, the only emotion I showed up after reading is ridiculousness. Some information given in this book may be right and may have its own supporting idea; however, I think it is totally wrong for the author of this book to deny climate change and global warming, which was caused by human beings. When I was reading this book, I almost got into his “word game” and had an idea of whether it is true that climate change isn’t happening. However, I am reminded of the thing taught by professor Hiltner at the first class in this quarter. Ice in both the North pole and South pole are all melting. Also, this book may have its own evidence to support; Nevertheless, I think it is absolutely wrong that these books are given to some teachers and students. During these students’ age and for people who have no idea about any information about climate change, they will be misleading easily. Can you imagine that more and more people in the world believe that climate change isn’t happening in the real world and even if it takes place, people should not take responsibility for this situation。 How serious this problem will be! Without support from the new generation, the problem of climate change can never be solved. In the future, I hope that more and more people will focus on this problem. Whether it is caused by humans or not, there is no disadvantage if people focus more on climate change.

After reading all of the front material and the first 3 chapters of “Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming,” I’m not going to lie, I was immediately very confused. Honestly, writing this right now I’m still a little hazy, but I read over some of the notes I took while reading and feel as if I have some sort of clarity now. Especially after the lecture today, 1/24/20, I feel like I have a better insight on this type of text. When Ken showed us in lecture today the sources for the text, I was astonished. It truly speaks to the credibility of the content since the only reliable sources they cited went against their argument and the only sources that were backing up their argument was the Heartland Institute. It’s important to note that the Heartland Institute was already affiliated with this text. The reading is hypocritical to their own arguments numerous times. For instance, they claim that fewer than 100 scientists in the world are actually knowledgeable about this aspect of debate, yet try to support their argument by saying that a few thousand scientists don’t agree with the idea that human greenhouse gas emissions have an intense direct correlation with global warming. Another demonstration of hypocrisy is when they try to argue that we should not believe the scientists that believe humans are impacting global warming because people are bias, thus these scientists are bias. If this argument is true, wouldn’t this mean the people writing this specific text are bias as well? Wouldn’t that mean that all their claims are biased? In addition, this text argues that the people who believe that humans are impacting global warming didn’t discover this, but are out seeking for information that would support this claim. In other words, the scientists are making the claim before they have evidence, and are gearing the evidence towards their claim. But isn’t this exactly what the authors of this text are doing as well?
   <br><Br>
    I’m still confused on why Ken would have us read this text for this course, if anybody has any ideas, please let me know.

The authors of this book wrote it really well, granted that no book will ever change what I believe about climate change, I can see how reading this novel can make someone become a climate change skeptic. A lot of climate change deniers says that our planet is in a cycle and this is normal for our planet to be experiencing. I have had to experience this type of thinking first hand within my own family; at this past Christmas, my uncle was trying to tell me that I need to study geology, because it shows that climate change is not real, but that our planet goes through cycles like this, and it is normal. Also my Uncle that was arguing this with me is very educated, attending UC Berkeley and Cal Poly Slo, and is now an architect with his own company. This just shows that type of thinkers there still are out in the world, and educated thinkers, with power to influence others. Nobody will ever sway my opinion that climate change is real, and humans are the cause of it, but this book could put doubt into others minds with less strong opinions. 
   <br><Br>

 I am always open to hearing other sides and educating others on problems within our world, but I do not agree with this book and it being sent out to many K through 12 teachers in 2017. Growing up kid’s opinions tend to coincide with their parents, or any other higher authority feeding them knowledge. This makes me upset to hear that all these educators started becoming skeptics after reading this, because more than ever we need the younger generations to also be aware of this crisis, so they can too act and make change. It is never too young, in my opinion, to educate the youth on topics like climate change. I understand the author's point of view, but I do not agree with it, and believe that sending them out to educators for free is even worse.

The book "Why Scientist Disagree About Global Warming" did a good job at hiding behind professionalism to spread bias. Each point that was made was backed up with evidence that honestly seemed convincing, especially to those who aren't properly informed or undecided about their stance on climate change. Reading this book frustrated me immensely as to why someone would go such lengths to just prove a point that apparently isn't even real. The reason always will be money and the people who really believe global warming isn't real are the ones who are getting paid by the fossil fuel industry I found it ironic how one part mentioned,"Bias is often unconscious or overcome by personal ethnics, but sometimes it leads to outright corruption"(pg48).The fact that his book was shipped to 300,000  teachers in hopes the information would be spread to children seemed propaganda like. This audience either has no bias or simply uninformed. What's worse is their arguments do appear well put together and I found myself wondering if some of their claims were true. Trying to put your money hungry statistics into the minds of impressionable listeners doesn't combat the damage we see in real time. All the proof that you need about whether climate change is real has been given to us. The dying coral reefs and ecosystems, the increasing amount of natural disasters, and the struggle in third world countries all prove this. Mother Nature will never lie. A common theme in the book using the word "alarmist" in a negative connotation to make those who agree with climate change seem over the top or even a little crazy for going to such extremes on this issue. This again seemed ironic to me considering the lengths the writers went like making their book free and even shipping it personally to teachers. It is extremely disheartening to see such wealthy and big companies use their voice wrongly and with selfish intentions. This problem shouldn't be a topic that divides us but rather it should bring us together to fix the damage we all have a part in causing.

After reading the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change”, I realize that some of  the scientists argues that global warming is not caused by human activities. What else, majority of environmental teachers don’t know how to protect the environment and how to teach their children. This is a big problem. As the global warming becomes more and more serious. It is really important to teach the next generation how to protect the environment. If the teacher is clear about the solution and what to do, how can they teach their students? No one can deny that human activities cause a huge influence to the environment. So what we should do is to let more people know how serious the global warming is and how to protect our planet.

When I first read the title of the book, I immediately had to laugh. I find it very ironic that Ken has mentioned several times how the term "global warming" is severely outdated and doesn't nearly represent all the consequences of climate change, which is why the term "climate crisis" is far more accurate. The fact that the authors of this book deliberately used the words "global warming" makes me think that they are still living in the past where people denied the reality of climate change. As somebody who definitely believes in anthropomorphic climate change, the title of the book was enough to make me question every little argument they made. Maybe I would have listened more if they had called it "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change".
   <br><Br>


One sentence in the book that particularly struck my attention was "Economists are likely to ask if the benefits of trying to 'stop' global warming outweigh the benefits of providing clean water of electricity to billions of people living in terrible poverty". It is very funny to me that climate deniers are preaching about more important issues that our world is facing, yet probably do absolutely nothing to combat those issues. How often do we hear the argument that we should rather focus on issues like poverty, terrorism, etc. instead of the climate? Well, then why don't those people do that? I find it hard to believe that the authors of this book have spent their time and resources trying to fight world poverty, yet they act like people who are actually doing something against our world's problems - like climate change - are delusional. Even if the climate crisis were a hoax, wouldn't it be a much better way to spend their time by improving issues that "are" real - like global poverty - instead of trying to convince people that some issues "aren't"? How dare the authors of this book think they are so much better than everyone else when they don't even use their voice and power to make a difference in the world that would actually help millions of people! Instead, they discredit something that scientists have spent years trying to convince the general public of. 
   <br><Br>
For all those reasons, I found it very difficult to take the book, and its authors, seriously.

I completely agree with your points; as would any one who believes that anthropogenic climate change is real. I did not even think about the title of the report, but you're right-- by calling it "global warming" it just goes to show that this reported is living in the past or more in denial. It has gone from "global warming" to "climate change" to "climate crisis" showcasing that this issue is rapidly growing and needs to be taken seriously. However, the authors of this report aren't even credited, as ken mentioned, 97% of scientist agree on the climate crisis and have proven enough evidence and then some for it to be true. So I find it absolutely ridiculous that these authors even bother to create this report. no one should take them seriously.

It is definitely interesting to see how the reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” presents its side of arguments. At the first glance, it seems convincing, because of the words it uses and the layers of arguments presented. The reading repeats several times that the number of scientists who have participated in certain surveys or have signed certain statements is overestimated. It almost seems like the author cannot come up with a better reason to support the argument. Also, the reading suggests the untrustworthiness of scientists’ arguments because only a few of them are expertise across several fields of studies. If most scientists are so incompetent, then why does he even make the previous arguments as if the scientists’ opinions really matter?

This reading pushes the agenda of fossil fuel industries to stir disbelief in climate change. I agree that through eloquent prose and an academic tone, it is disguised to be manipulated. I really like that Ken included this because we are building a foundation of knowledge regarding the climate crisis, but our understanding is only as credibility as our ability to refute and deny counter-arguments or attempts to destroy support. For example, one point was what you said -- because the scientists are not all concentrated or specialized in the field or several fields, they should automatically be rejected. From first glance or maybe after growth from this class, this should come off as ridiculous. Even I, a mere college student seeking a Political Science major, am not educated to this extent, but have the competence to realize the earth has not been the same, is getting worse, and this change is due to how poorly we treat this planet. Though there are a lot of the times we accept what is presented to us without further research, we should refrain from this because it is a toxic trait. If that is the case, all who would stumble upon this would end up accepting the text and would believe climate change is a hoax and that is dangerous!

For me personally, one of the arguments that also have me hesitate is all the changes that would be done. This isn’t an argument whether or not climate change exists, but rather what can be done. We have largely doomed our earth and hearing about the melting glaciers, burning forests and hills, rising temperature, and such matters seems so out of reach. Politicians that offer 180 lifestyles are mocked and seen as ridiculous. This is a huge argument, a huge belief that it will be too costly to change things like our nationwide infrastructure and this would end up ruining our economy once more. But what will we do when we don’t have an economy anymore because of this negligence and refusal to take action? It will cost less over time, especially considering how solar panels are inexpensive AND how we already have experienced disasters as a result of climate change and spend millions to restore these areas. In addition to this, as lecture brought up,generally moving towards green economy would arguably help the economy as we need to employ people for installations and building of technologies, new buildings, and other renovations.

I was also intrigued by how The Heartland Institute presents information, or should I say mis-information.  There were times when I was reading the report and I thought to myself that these were valid arguments, but I had to remember that they do an amazing job of mis-quoting and using facts out of context to prove their point.  
   <br><Br>


It was also interesting to read the comments on the book on amazon.  It is hard to remember that there is a significant segment of the American population that does not believe in climate change.  In lecture I was thinking how while everyone in this room believes climate change is a massive issue and needs to be fixed, there could be a climate class at Ole Miss where everyone in the room believes climate change is a hoax.  Similarly, I think if we want to really make a difference in our world, we need to move out of our echo chamber and not exclude conservatives.  They make up 50% of the population, and have stopped a significant amount of climate policy.  We must work together, not against one another to change the world.

Considering the interests of their own groups, many politicians oppose anthropogenic factors when discussing climate crisis. They often point to the lack of scientific consensus among the society as their evidence. This is what confuses me. Why is consensus so important? I agree with a sentence in the book: "Disagreement is the rule and consensus is the exception in most academic disciplines." Failure to reach consensus does not mean that it is not a fact that humans are destroying the planet. We should follow the truth, even if only a few people think so, instead of following the wrong ideas of the majority. In today's society, celebrities try to control people's thoughts in different ways, such as media. We cannot be decieved by them. In addition, Ken mentioned the problems in the way of teaching children about climate crisis. Teachers rarely mention the effects of anthropogenic factors on the climate, and even some do not teach about climate issues at all. Instead, they try to persuade students that nature has more impacts on climate. This is really terrible. If children do not receive correct knowledge about climate issues, they will ignore the problem when they grow up. Among these children, some will become the future leaders. Because of the lack of consciousness, they will not actively respond to the change. The condition of our planet will become even worse as a result.

I agree with your idea that failure to reach a consensus cannot deny its authenticity completely since most academic disciplines are doubtable at the beginning. Most scientific evidence indicated that climate change is anthropogenic but the society still needs to spend some time to accept it. However, many factories and politicians care more about their financial and political interests, deceiving people that the climate crisis is ridiculous and encouraging people to live wasteful lifestyles. Their selfishness has negative influences on the climate crisis since people may not believe in climate crisis if they listen to completely opposite ideas on articles, advertisements, media, and speeches. Thus, advocating environmentally-friendly lifestyles is hard to achieve after so many years. Also, Ken mentioned some teachers even refuse to tell the negative impact of climate change to students. Thus,  young people are unlikely to own environmental consciousness in the future and it will be a vicious cycle.

The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” has given different good perspective to bring us to think deeply and more careful about the problem of climate crisis that we all have been talking about over. It is nice to look at how the book in the first three chapters focus on explaining why it thinks that there are no scientific consensus, the scientists are not fully confident about the evidence given for climate crisis, their credibilities are being doubted and people’s hypothesis and conclusion are based on the previous research which lack of credibility, full of bias and is merely a political/economic driven thing.While I actually understand why and how the authors come with these ideas and it is always a good thing to examine and judge one’s hypothesis from different perspectives, because this is what science/research is about.We cannot merely rely on one’s saying with getting an independent thinking and see if that idea has enough evidence to support it or not; however, the things that the book has mentioned in the first three chapters only makes me to rethink and position the alarmist is taking and the perspectives of those support the idea that climate change exists. It doesn’t not completely persuade me that climate change is not real and to think that all the research and what the scientists are thinking are wrong.The key points mentioned in the book lead me step by step to rethink carefully about the content that the article/research has been written about that climate changing is happening, but it didn’t lead me to think the climate deniers’ sides are completely right, since this book only provide explanation on what are some areas e.g. evidence, data,etc that it thinks the people agree with climate crisis need to provide more on to support its thought. At the same time, this book is in a lot of the time repeating and questioning and doubting the same concepts to reject the others’ sides but it didn’t give evidence on what exactly others are wrong and the climate deniers’ side are correct.
   <br><Br>
Still, from my own perspective, the existence of climate crisis didn’t completely get proved by a group with certainty that climate change is in no way not related to human activities at all.

After discussing this week's reading in class and then actually doing the reading I can say that I am not surprised that many Americans still truly believe climate change is a 'hoax'. "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is the perfect way to make teachers, politicians, and the population turn their heads on real science, because it was literally created to trick us. At first glance you might think you're reading another scientific article. In class Ken pointed out little things in the text that I wouldn't have noticed the first time doing the reading. The authors will insert a quote or statistic and then claim it's incorrect or false. Then when reviewing the works cited you see credible sources like NASA, IPCC, AAAS and come to find that they used all those sources in order to contradict or disagree with them. How can an institution like NASA be incorrect? That is where I am slightly concerned about America. We have become more accustomed to believing everything we read. I admit I am also at fault. I read about something online and immediately believe it and then share with my friends and family, but then come to find out it's not 100% accurate. Although there is a difference between internet gossip and the issue of global climate change and questions 97% of scientists. In addition, the works cited is also filled with sources of The Heartland Institute. I researched The Heartland Institute and it's defined as a conservative think tank. The first though that comes to my mind after reading that is "what happened to the separation of church and state?" Let's leave religion up to the churches and education up to the teachers and science up to the scientists. I'm worried that a large portion of my generation is getting sucked into the "climate change is a hoax" propaganda. I remember some kids in high school playing it off as if it was a joke, and I think sometimes it can be funny how black and white our politics have become, because it seems as if no one can every agree on any issue. But, in this case the climate crisis isn't far in the future, we're facing the consequences right now, so I don't understand how people can still sit back and joke around as if their house couldn't possibly flood or catch on fire in the next year. In conclusion, left me feeling slimy and fake, because of my background reading the book "Merchants of Doubt" for a history class last year. I understand how people like Fred Singer operate. They twist every little thing from a piece of scientific evidence and make the common American question it or disagree with it all together. It needs to stop now.

After reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I was forced to give grudging respect to the authors.  Though I feel their viewpoints are wrong and their methodology is flawed, I cannot deny they wrote a reasonably convincing argument.  My first read through, I missed some key warning flags, such as largely citing unreliable or biased sources or not sourcing their stronger claims.  This attempt to essentially corrupt future generations is despicable and honestly may have fooled me a little. It was only after reading the article a second time that I was able to see through the facade and false positives.  
   <br><Br>


The issue with this is that many people will not read this a second time.  The main issue with targeting teachers and politicians/influencers is that they are the ones children listen to and learn from the most.  And as the goal of these groups is to just spread doubt, it will help foster a young generation that are at best, climate skeptics.  Children who were taught this flawed work will inherently believe it and be more resistant to change, even when the facts are obvious.  
   <br><Br>


The only comfort after reading this was that many people are already skeptical of it.  A large portion of the reviews for this text (excluding the obvious shills) are either negative or skeptical of the work itself.  This implies that most teachers are not accepting the alternate viewpoint despite Heartland's best efforts.  The tragic thing is that if even 5% of teachers accept this narrative, they will potentially poison the education regarding climate change for millions of students, which Heartland will consider a victory.

When I started to read the book, “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change," I went in with a tentative mind as I had been warned by Ken during the deep dive lectures of the convincing argument that the text makes in disrupting public opinion on the climate crisis. Coming in with such background information, such as the documentaries "Climate of Doubt" and "Merchants of Doubt" definitely caused a more biased reading. I am uncertain as to whether even without said information, that I would even be convinced by their arguments. Their aggressive nature behind a lot of the wording and direct attacks toward individuals would have certainly put me on edge. Often many of their "debunkings" were not truly supported well and you mainly had to take their word for it. The authors were quick to point out flaws in surveys, publicized information, journals, etc. The most pertinent example was their "debunking" of the claim that "97 percent of scientists agree" on anthropogenic climate change. They mainly picked and prodded at the sources used, the legitimacy, and argued that there was no consensus. However, it felt like a pot meet kettle situation as many of their tactics could be easily directed back at them because many of their sources were derived from one individual organization, that being the Heartland Institute. That is to say that I personally don't believe that a college educated individual would be easily convinced by this composition without factoring in other sources. However, that doesn't really matter as it's obvious that their target audience isn't the person with a degree, but rather the impressionable public, bluntly seen by their approach to spread the book as to as many influencers as possible. Therefore, the existence of these types of texts both worry me and don't surprise me. It's obvious that the  reason behind the recent prominence of the debate over climate change are influential sources similar to this text, even when 8 years ago or so there was a more definite consensus, at least politically.

I agree that this book had a very aggressive tone and that they continued to use certain examples they thought would strengthen their opinions. I also agree that many of the points they were trying to argue were either not backed with proper evidence and if they did use evidence it was mainly from fossil fuel supporting organizations like the Heartland Institute. This part felt so ironic to me since in the very beginning of the report they mention how environmental activists are often challenged by "a tiny minority of scientists funded by the fossil fuel industry". One part of the book I had a major issue with was the part about "Merchants of Doubt" by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway. In ES 106, we had to read this book and complete a paper in which we had to look into one of the references cited and see how well the author used that evidence. We had to critically analyze how the author used this source and check to see if it was reputable.After looking into the source, I believe that the authors used the source very well and did not manipulate the source to align with their book. In addition, I noticed that many of the quotes they used were from people and organizations that believed in climate change and that they would state something and then try to debunk it without scientific data from peer reviewed journals or any other scientific evidence, only mainly stating their opinions. One point you made that I do not completely agree with is that college educated individuals would not be easily convinced by this book. Although students like you and I have been exposed to materials that have made us familiar with the environmental crisis, that is not the case for many students, especially students that may go to schools outside of California. I also think that students with a bias towards denial of the climate crisis would see this book as a tool they could use to debunk many climate change facts. I do agree though that this book was probably meant to be seen by the wider, impressionable public and turn this crisis into a two sided debate. Sadly, if texts like these are sent to the public, free of charge and accessible, I think that this will continue to promote that climate change is a two sided argument, when in reality there is major consensus from leading climate scientists that anthropogenic climate change is real.

I agree that the aggressive nature of the authors is off-putting, "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change" reads more like an attack rather than a genuine attempt at scientific reasoning. I went into this week somewhat excited, in a weird way. I really want to understand the views of climate change deniers, and I hoped this reading would give me insight into their logic. I was immediately bothered by the opening sentence in which Marita Noon bashes Obama and "his followers" for stressing the importance of climate change. By the time she calls the climate crisis a "public relations campaign" in the next paragraph, she had completely lost me. I suppose the authors thought that opening their book with something so bold and controversial would set an authoritative tone, but in reality it reads very unscholarly and makes me distrust their book from the beginning. I was also stricken by their lack of sources. I'm not used to reading something claiming to be a scientific study but lacking substantial evidence to back up their claims. It really bothers me when someone with no qualifications and no evidence "debunks" science that experts in their field have spent their lives studying.
   <br><Br>
The fact that this book was distributed to cause confusion among the teachers of our youth, "elected officials, civic and business leaders, scientists, and other opinion leaders" is sickening. Of course everyone should look at all sides of every argument, but the climate crisis can be very hard to accept at times. This book exploits the average American's desire to ignore the crisis by creating confusion through essentially persuasive lies. NCES.ed.gov reports that only about 18% of Americans have a bachelor degree in a STEM field. That means that 82% of our country gets their scientific understanding from the news, internet, and books like this one. As you said, “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change" preys on those people with little to no understanding of the scientific process. Now that I realize that climate change deniers really have no true counter argument, I'm even more frustrated about the situation we are currently in.

The forward began by talking about President Obama and his “followers” the choice of words made me think it was coming from a right-wing author and made me lift my guard about how biased their research may be. Despite that, I would be lying if I said the first couple of chapters were not even a little bit convincing. They made it seem like they had credible evidence to debunk every climate change “myth” by including references every couple of pages. When they said that climate scientists like all humans can be biased, it made me think of how that same argument can be applied to their argument. How are they proving that they are not biased? They are trying to present this “evidence” to their readers claiming they are biased to say climate change is real while they are being funded by the fossil fuel industries. 
   <br><Br>

While listening to the lecture, I was surprised to learn about educators teaching that climate change is a two-sided argument. It makes it sound like they are not even sure what to think about the climate change debate but that is dangerous when these children look up to those who teach them for guidance. Since their uncertainty has been well documented, it makes sense why these authors decided to send copies of these books to schools. If they were to take the time to read through the chapters, they would find that their arguments are weak; for example, they say there is no one expert on it so their claims should not be regarded but they should be specialized in one area and collaborate on the wider problem. It makes me sad to think some teenagers who wanted to learn more about the climate change issue are handed this book with this convincing format and decide that climate change is not real.

I too, found it very sad to think of kids in school who may be given this information from their teachers, individuals who they look at as trusted adults.  I personally did not even begin to learn about anthropogenic climate change as an overarching issue until high school, and it was because I self-selected an elective on Environmental Science, and am now learning more about it now as a choice I made to take this specific course.  It's unfortunate to think that not only are students not being given opportunities to learn about the climate crisis, but that when they are, many of them are being fed false information.  

   <br><Br>

I agree with you also that it's scary how convincing the book seems.  I think the key strategy that was used by the author in the book was targeting the "alarmists."  It was to "debunk" their views, not just present his own.  Something like the line, "Extensive survey data show deep disagreement among scientists on scientific issues that must be resolved before the man-made global warming hypothesis can be validated" is so worrisome because we need to act now, and it is with texts like these that are going to so negatively impact us.  As Ken mentioned in lecture, much of the text was left without any kind of research or reliable sources to back it up, which many people may not be smart enough or aware enough to look for.  "Deep disagreement among scientists on scientific issues,"when you think about it, this sounds ridiculous, unbelievable, and just plain uneducated.  Which it is.  But, many people may look at the whole sentence, and fall right into the trap which was set out for them. This is deeply worrisome.  I hope though, that by showing us this, Ken has opened the eyes of my peers and myself to be more aware and too look for things like this in the news and other sources of media that are presenting lies to us, and to be stronger than them and reject what we know is false.

Before I started reading “Why Scientist Disagree About Global Warming” I had in mind to be unbiased and understand both sides of the debate. I really tried to analyze why and how people don’t believe climate change is real. However, I personally found this book confusing and while reading through the text I realized the hypocrisy of the author. In chapter one, there is a quote that reads, “A 97% consensus claim is merely a “social proof” - a powerful psychological motivator intended to make the public comply with the heard” (Pg. 19). This quote is coming from a book that mailed 300,000 copies to K-12 teachers and college professors. Sending unwanted material to people is a psychological game trick to make people behave a certain way. This is a dangerous move because if a teacher is convinced that climate change isn’t real then, he/she will teach that ideology to the students. Thus, a younger generation will be the same as the older generation in claiming that climate change isn’t an issue. Furthermore, the author went on to say, “...by surveying the opinions and writings of scientists and nonscientists who may write about climate but are by no means experts on or even casually familiar with the science dealing with attribution…”(Pg. 12). The Heartland Institute supports Christopher Monckton, a British public speaker, who is not a scientist and has ZERO knowledge on science/climate, yet aggressively denies any sort of climate crisis. Monckton goes around “educating” people how climate change isn’t real and that there’s nothing to worry about. How can deniers attack full-time scientists on being "inaccurate" and "evil", when their people are not even scientists themselves?

The book “ Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” surely did bomb my mind. It stands against the mainstream consensus view that global warming is a serious problem needs to be handled right now due to its capability of posing a dangerous threat to our planet. This book, however, stated a few arguments to support its distinct view that global warming is not a threat at all. Those arguments might seem reasonable at first, but with our common sense knowledge and the ones we learned in the lectures, we can easily pinpoint the absence of logic in the arguments. For example, the book said that we perceive climate change as truth is because of the unbalanced number of scientific articles published by the alarmists and skeptics. For example, it brought in this statistic: the 50 most prolific alarmists have published an average of 408 times, whereas the number is only 89 times for the skeptics. Here, this book tried to convince us that we lack the basic critical thinking to distinguish the truth from the numbers. In fact, it is the author of this book who lacks the critical thinking of interpreting the authoritatively published factual information, and the ability to observe the surrounding environment. There are, no doubt, tons of factual information and credible statistics that describe the rising sea level, the carbon emission, and deforestation. Additionally, any educated person would be able to realize the severity of climate change by watching the news, observing the more and more extreme weather conditions, and experiencing warmer winters and hotter summers. As a result, this book is incredibly ridiculous in misleading people to recognize the truth of climate change. Without employing a correct perspective on this issue, how are we, as the fellow residents of this planet, be able to make changes that will mitigate the crisis?

Since the very beginning of this reading, it has explicitly stated how climate science is a complex matter that involves the contribution of all fields in science. They state how scientists who support climate change are only experts in one field of science. They question whether or not the public should believe climate change advocates due to this sole fact. However, when looking at their argument, it also contradicts their case as well, considering the fact that scientists who deny climate change are also only experts in one field of science. Climate, as they say it, is a complex phenomenon that we do not fully understand yet. So, if this is the case, how can they truly say that climate change advocates are wrong for believing that human activities is what’s causing the earth to warm at rates that are exceeding post-industrial times. 
   <br><Br>


What I found very interesting from this reading is the Global Warming Petition Project. It composes of statements that urges the government to not side with climate change advocates. It also states how limiting the use of greenhouse gas would “hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind.” What’s also shocking in this statement is how they stated, “there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.” This is important because it’s important to take into consideration that although plants need CO2, we are producing it at an exceeding rate. There aren’t enough plants to take in the CO2 we emit, especially with all the wildfires going on. 
   <br><Br>


Also the precautionary principle stated in chapter 3 is important because climate change advocates wholeheartedly believe that it’s better to be safe than sorry and I think that’s how we should all view this climate issue. We should take action now while we still can, instead of waiting for a major sign to inform us that climate change is real and inevitable. The signs and consequences of our actions are here and now. As people who believe in the preservation of our world, we have to take action immediately.

While reading “why scientists disagree about global warming” I was generally confused on why you were having us read a book about how climate change cannot be proven as harmful. It did sound very conservative and at times, stupid. I realized towards the end that it was biased and showed how the person paying the scientist really affects the outcome of their studies. It was also confusing that there were many people who did not have PhDs or even masters degrees in any field who were part of publishing the articles. At the same time, there are many things we read daily that we just believe that have no scientific evidence behind it. This is also similar to Leonardo Dicaprio’s impact on the environmentalist. He is an actor with no PhD in environmental studies but he has still been extremely influential to other environmentalists. Now, as a student who believes in climate change, I see nothing wrong with him because he has passion. But, to a climate change denier, this is a perfect opportunity to pry apart my own beliefs. 
   <br><Br>

On the topic of the students being taught about climate change, I think they should be taught facts, not biases. Until there is enough evidence to support/not support climate change, it should not be taught in K-12 education whatsoever. This is too similar to teaching about religions or political biases. This is way too complex to be teaching the younger children due to not all aspects being known. The elephant metaphor was a perfect example of climate change. The idea that not one scientist knows everything about every area of science is straight facts. There is so much that one has to learn to specialize in areas of science, plus more due to advancements made daily.

The book “Why scientists disagree about global warming” seemed very convincing to me at times. Initially, It made the dangers of climate change seem less important. Indicating that there was no consensus made me doubt a little and so I felt more interested in knowing why some scientists disagree with climate change. I think that starting with such idea was very strategic because most people fear the truth about climate change and being told that it’s not real can rapidly attract people’s minds. Even though the book seemed a bit convincing, everything seemed more clearly after watching ken’s video. 
   <br><Br>
It’s sad to see that fossil fuel companies do anything just to misinform people about what is really going on. They go and fund conservative think tanks. Moreover, the fact that 300,000 copies of the book were sent teachers so that they misinform children who are the future for this planet. This can result in terrible consequences. There can be more disasters since the people who were taught as children that climate change wasn’t a problem, will not do something to stop climate change. Rather they will let it happen and suffer. By that time who will be there to save them. I feel like this act of teaching the wrong idea is also unfair since we have the right to an opinion. Children should have an opinion on climate change as well.

I agree with you wholeheartedly. It so disappointing that these fossil fuel lobbyists are preying on the trust that children have for their teachers. This whole tactic is completely sickening, and they're accusing scientists and teachers who are informed of doing exactly what they are doing. We should all be up in arms about climate change, but these politicians do not want to lose their money or their support from those that do not care. They know that they will be long dead when what they consider to be the "worst" outcomes of climate change.
<br><br>
It is, in fact, impossible to care about the children of your country or world while also actively passing legislation to keep them uninformed about their own doom. Their whole platform is confusion, abusing trust, and clinging to the few facts that help them. It's so convincing if you don't know that it's intentional.

I find it really sad that we as a society have such different and polarized views on climate change when we as a society need to come together instead as one to combat it. I agree with what you said about how they said there was little to no consensus about climate change but I think some good could also come out of that. Although there is allegedly no one singular idea that contributes to climate change, I believe all these ideas could fuel the younger generations to act. Just because climate change isn’t due to one thing doesn’t mean it can’t be due to dozens. For all we know, climate change could be due to all these conditions simultaneously happening that could be hurting our planet the most and if we continue to deny that, we’ll continue to go down the path of most destruction due to our own part in it.
<br><hr>

When you said that when you saw the author told the audience that climate change was not that serious, you had more interest to read it. I find it interesting, because when I read the book, I did not realize that I had the same opinion. But after I read your comment and I recall my feelings, I find I had the same feeling with you. Your explanation is great. Sometimes, people choose to avoid facing the facts when they are informed that the facts are horrible. That’s what I always do. If someone told me that the facts might be overwhelming to me, I would tell them not to tell me, because I am afraid of it. However, after hearing Ken’s opinion. I think the author should not write this to misinform the audience. There is a need to inform the public how serious climate change is now, instead misinforming the public that climate change is not that serious. People who do not have a consciousness about the severity of climate change might be misleading by this book, which is bad for us to take actions to protect the earth. And you mentioned this book has printed a lot and sent to students. I feel sad too, because I do not want children had a wrong idea about climate change when they are young, otherwise it is hard to correct them in the future.

<br><hr>
I also thought some of the “arguments” and “evidences” the book brought up were convincing, but after looking further into the sources, I realized that those arguments are based upon sketchy/unreliable or no sources at all. On page 50, the book cites a source from the Heartland Institute, saying that there has never been a climate scientist who accepted money to change his/her stance. I searched up the Heartland Institute, and I was not surprised to find that most of their articles were against climate change activists and was extremely skeptical about man-made climate change. For example, the titles of other articles include “Climate Crackpots Lose in Court Again” and “Federal Appeals Court Dismisses Oregon Youths’ Climate Lawsuit”. There is also an article arguing that the recent Australian wildfire is a result of bad fire management. The other sources cited are mostly all institutions that deny climate change, so they don’t even consider the other side of the argument.
   <br><Br>
Regarding your point on the book distribution - if someone received the book and only flipped through the pages, I wouldn’t be surprised if they believed it. It’s the same concept as people believing whatever article they read on the internet. People think that if it is a published book that seems to have a lot of cited sources, it must be reliable. A very few of them would pay attention to the sources unlike the students in this class.

After watching this video and reading the article, I am surprised by how much of an impact these climate deniers have had on our everyday lives and what we as a society are doing to combat climate change. After reading this article, I became even more wary of what's next for our country. How can there be so many people blatantly denying climate change when it is so clearly evident in our everyday lives. These selfish and scary views need to be changed in order to get all the help we need to combat climate change. In the article, the author was attempting to convince the readers that the climate crisis that we are dealing with is a natural phenomenon that occurs every century or so and that it is not as severe as people are making it out to be. It is ridiculous that someone can deny the effects climate crisis has had on people, animals, and environments, and entire ecosystems. The evidence he offered, I will admit is probably compelling to some readers, which is why we need to strike back with more evidence and solutions to helping save out planet. Along with this, the book is published by “Hartland Institute” which is a company trying to stop climate change activists. This is ridiculous. We need to step up and shut these people down for the sake of our planet and everything in it.

While this article could be convincing at times, I noticed a few things that served as red flags sticking out to me while reading. First and foremost, they stated that a large amount of books were given away and mailed to a significant amount of people. To me, this doesn’t prove that many people don’t believe, but rather points out this arguments desperation right off the bat. Secondly, because of that, I noticed rather quickly their blatant technique of merely attacking and putting down the other side, rather than simply rebutting their data. Instead of just gathering their own data, they only argued and took aim instead of just presenting new findings. They seemed largely to only be talking about definitions regarding wording, rather than numbers. This article did however point out flaws in the conduct of the IPCC, and made convincing arguments against the organization. That said, I felt that they failed to state explicitly what the actual flaws with IPCC’s data proving anthropogenic climate change are real, are. The last thing that stood out to me while reading is the outdatedness of many of the quotes that they used, with some being over twenty years old with regard to a situation that has changed quite a bit in that time.

I agree with you, this article illustrate how the argument against the idea that the climate crisis exists falls flat. In my opinion, this type of article is harmful in the fact of misinforming people of the climate crisis rather than presenting information for an argument.  In the article, the surface level conviction can only be stretched so far until it must rebuttal the evidence for the climate crisis. The article to me make the use of propaganda in the ways of trying to convince an average individual that the science and scientists supporting the ides that the climate crisis is real are lying to use, however, the article gives does not give an explanation on why their wrong but just that they are. This type of thinking is very dangerous as sometimes people can be kind of stupid, and I don't mean it in a bad way because I sometimes call myself stupid sometimes. The way the article presents itself as being widely recognized and respected through the scientific community by giving excerpts from people who I think are smart is a slimy way to present an argument. If someone who had not heard or been educated about the climate crisis reads this article, they might be very inclined to believe it due to how the the information of the argument is presented rather that what the argument is actual trying to make light of. I believe you're right on when you talk about the argument that the article made against the IPCC and how they failed to explicitly state the problems with their findings and data. This is systemic throughout the entire article, at the beginning of the course with not much knowledge about the climate crisis, I might have been inclined to believe quite a bit more than I had after reading it this past week. This just goes to how everything you read must me taken into context with other sources and ideas to help form a complete argument about an idea.

After reading the first three chapters of “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change,” I found myself absolutely disgusted. Actually, I started to feel disgusted not too long after beginning to read the text, and by the time I finished I was appalled. It infuriates me to no end that people, and by people I mean climate change denialists usually associated with the fossil fuel industry, have the nerve to try and spread disinformation on such an important issue, simply so that they can keep their profits coming in. Any sane human being with the most basic morals should be able to see that the climate crisis is one that will threaten everybody on this planet, no matter their skin color, religion, nationality, political views, the language that they speak, et cetera. Any such person with the capability to think about something other than themselves and how much money they make should be able to understand that climate change is unequivocally the most dangerous issue facing the human race. Yet, the people at the top of fossil fuel companies and their ilk not only refuse to see it this way, but they actively attempt to sow doubt and disagreement into the minds of the general populace in order to prolong the status quo in which they are allowed to pollute the Earth to the point of catastrophe, with green dollar signs in their eyes the entire time. 

   <br><Br>

I will praise The Heartland Institute for the amount of work they put into this publication, as well as the amount of mental gymnastics they had to do in order to make seemingly plausible arguments against climate change- which, I think is worth noting, they stubbornly call ‘global warming’ instead: an outdated and inaccurate term for the crisis that faces our planet. Yet, while reading, I couldn’t shake off a perception of all of their arguments and ‘facts’ as being very surface-level. By that, I mean they repeatedly made comments and bold statements without backing it up with concrete supporting evidence, as much as they try to make it seem as if they have proper and credible cited sources. This is something that Ken brought up in lecture as well. Not for a second did I buy into their arguments on why climate change can’t be caused by humans or how ‘most’ scientists disagree about it; as Ken showed us, a huge number of reputable and credible organizations of all kinds have supported the statement that 97% of scientists agree that human activity is leading to the effects of climate change that we have been observing.

After reading the article “Why Scientists Disagree with Climate Change,” I was surprised by the way it was written, and also angered. I have formed my opinions on climate change having built up my knowledge on the subject for a few years now. This article opened my eyes to show that there are two sides to every story and it is now apparent to me how people can be persuaded by only the information presented in front of them. If I were to rely solely off of the information presented in this article I would also likely believe all that is stated as the jargon within this article is convincing. Some of the facts and statistics given in regards to climate change seemed biased or unreliable due to the non credible sources that were used. Regardless of whether the climate crisis is caused by humans or not there is still action that needs to be taken to combat the noticeable change that both opinions can see. The climate crisis becomes a greater threat every day and the only way that it can be stopped is if sides are not picked. While the solution to the climate crisis will need to be a societal effort, there are still changes that can be made on an individual level as well regardless of opinions of the topic. Education and knowledge on both sides of the subject is necessary.

I totally agree with your point about how the information is presented in this argument. I feel that the authors purposely placed all of their facts and statistics as summaries at the beginnings of their chapters because they knew that the majority of their readers would not read the entire document. And because of this, they would not verify the accuracy of their sources. By intentionally placing all of their information at the start of their chapter, they are manipulating their reader. As Ken noted in lecture, only attentive readers would verify the context of their references as well as the sources. Disregarding everything else, I feel that the fact that the publisher of the book (The Heartland Institute) is also the supporter of many of their studies is suspicious.  
   <br><Br>
Because of this, I also feel that the facts and statistics seem biased and suspicious. Like the video for this week noted, you can find cooling trends in the data over the last few decades, it just matters where you place the start and endpoints. The ease of manipulation of the data suggests that it may be easier to produce biased or skewed data than the public believes.
   <br><Br>
By confusing the public on the issue of Climate Change, the Heartland Institute and other climate change deniers are only hurting the planet further. The longer it takes for the United States to address the issue, the more damage will be inflicted upon the planet. Using questionable sources or funding campaigns to question the legitimacy of climate change claims does not only waste financial resources, but it also wastes precious time.


<br><Hr>
I agree that the article presented their argument well in some cases, causing me to rethink the IPCC's arguments. I've believed in anthropogenic climate change for years, so I felt guilty for second-guessing the science that I've been exposed to through research and many classes here at UCSB. However, many of their arguments were based upon tearing down alarmists, labeling them as unfit to make these sort of claims. What frustrated me was the remarks that the NIPCC made against these scientists of many fields, attempting to invalidate their credibility by saying that their area of expertise could not possibly come to alarmist conclusions. The climate crisis is an interdisciplinary subject, requiring research from many fields because the earth is an ecosystem--everything is connected. 
   <br><Br>
The NIPCC also states that sustainable energy will make "little to no change," and claiming that even climate scientists admit this as well. They argue that the effects of climate change will continue to occur in the years after sustainable efforts have been incorporated. They say, "why bother," if we will face the disasters anyway. Though, this proves that the NIPCC's argument focuses on short-term effects. The climate can be compared to an air conditioner: it takes a while for a house to cool down once it's already hot. There's a delay once the air conditioner is turned on. Just because it's on doesn't mean that the house will be cool in that moment. There are many cycles that contribute to global temperature.Starting these sustainable practices now means that the "air conditioner" will kick in sooner. It will take decades for the global temperature to adjust, just as it took only decades to heat up.

I find it funny that the title of the book is "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," appealing to the pseudo-science of conservative politics and corporate interest. How can the people who published this book make such a statement considering how much money they spend trying to shut scientists up. Under the disguise of seemingly intelligent discourse, the book tries to convince readers to believe in weak arguments about the credibility of professional climatologists and to distrust climate scientists because of political interests and agendas. Absolutely ridiculous. Some of these arguments seem like pure filler that is meant to catch the eye of an uninformed reader. It's like they took arguments made against them and reformulated it to make it look like they're the good guys. 
   <br><Br>


The argument made about scientists only being specialized in a single area of science was incredibly dumb and counter-intuitive. First of all, I think specializing in a specific area such as physics would make the scientist much more informed than a scientist who studied physics and numerous other areas at the same time. The author seems to forget that part of the scientific process on a wide scale is collaboration. Yes, it is possible from scientists who only specialize in one area to come together and form solutions based on each of their individual research, specializing in their area of interest. In that case, it would make the research much more thorough and a larger collection of minds would provide a much more thorough consensus. 
   <br><Br>


The argument made about climate science being wrong because of underlying political agenda felt like it could be read as a satire. I just couldn't believe whoever wrote that section of the book even tried to make that argument. Remember when Newt Gingrich agreed with Nancy Pelosi on the severity of climate change and then a few years later, backed out and started to say the complete opposite. Or how about whoever funded the very book that's making this claim?

On the third page of actual text in this book, it reads “The number of scientists actually knowledgeable about this aspect of the debate may be fewer than 100 in the world. Several are prominent skeptics (John Christy, Richard Lindzen, Patrick Michaels, and Roy Spencer, to name only four) and many others may be” (12). If this statement, however absurd the claim, was true, and both parties were supposedly represented in the Zimmerman & Doran sample, then we could conclude that there would be about 100 responses of enough ‘validity’ to satisfy both parties. Even if all those who were responding in addition to the initial 79 scientists were not in consensus, then that would mean approximately 72 out of 100 scientists would still be in consensus, still an obvious majority. I don’t deny that perhaps the NIPCC would declare the already surveyed scientists as unqualified, however, if there is to be satisfaction on both sides as far as the sample, then this could predictably be the outcome in a redesigned version of this study (this is without, of course, any knowledge of the ideological standpoints of the theoretical scientists selected). This, therefore, would render their defamation of this study a moot point. 

   <br><Br>

Many of the arguments they’ve stated are riddled with hypocrisy and based in only small portions of data that cater to them directly. Frankly, the NIPCC is obviously clinging to their thin veil of validity. They place pages and pages of quotes from government officials to other scientists - primarily those already affiliated with other conservative think tanks sponsored by TNCs or figures like the Koch Brothers - before even touching upon their main arguments. It can be argued that this is commonplace, but with just a quick peek at their website the extents to which they go to assert their legitimacy is quite ridiculous. There’s even a ‘Credibility and Influence’ header under the ‘What We Do’ tab - these things, especially credibility, should be assumed from a leading research and education institution and I found it ridiculous the ways in which they continuously used persuasive tactics to try to solidify themselves as a well-grounded institution.

When reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” it became immediately clear to me that the purpose of the report was to provide vague, unsubstantiated information in order to deliberately confuse the reader and discredit real evidence for climate change.
   <br><Br>

For example, in Chapter 2 of the report, it compares the climate change debate among scientists to “a group of blind men touching various parts of an elephant, each arriving at a very different idea of what it is like.” By using this comparison, the article seems to try and convey that although scientists from different fields do valid research, the fact that they are each only looking at a small aspect of climate change makes their conclusions unreliable in understanding and projecting for such a complex issue. However, the report fails to consider that the specialization of these scientists actually makes their conclusions better at helping us to understand climate change, because their intense interest in a specific area of the issue will almost certainly yield better results than those of someone trying to figure out every part themselves. Nevertheless, the report uses this confusing metaphor in a half-hearted attempt to discredit evidence of climate change found by those in the scientific community, and doesn’t really give the reader any explanation that clears up the confusion created by their statement. As I read through the report, I found many similar examples of the authors making ambiguous, subjective statements, and then making no attempt to clear up their meanings or provide clarity for readers. 
   <br><Br>

Overall, I believe that an approach like this is very dangerous, as it clouds the truth of climate change  and only serves to confuse people so that they do not take action against the interest of the report.

I agree that the intention of this pseudo scientific book was to obscure the truth about climate change behind a guise of false information parading as gospel. In reading this book, I initially found myself be lulled into a false sense of security since it was so carefully written. Up closer analysis, the tactics used to distract the reader become apparent. Of course, it becomes easy easy to provide approvingly credible information when alI the factual evidence comes from the Heartland Institute. I also noticed their efforts to discredit scientists through their elephant metaphor in the beginning positing that because the analysis of the impact of pollution of the environment is multidisciplinary, scientists could not possibly understand what impact there truly is. I found this ironic because conversely, climate. change denialisms would not be able to know the extent. of pollution on the environment either. This destroyed their ethos because they essentially asserted that no one on either side of the argument could possibly know how great or little the impact pollution could have on the environment. 
   <br><Br>

By targeting teachers and distorting the truth about climate change, climate change denialists are trying to access and influence the next generation of children. Children are easily impressionable, hence education is so important in the developmental years of a child's life. By trying to establish climate change falsehoods in children, organizations like the Heartland Institute are trying to establish a political base within the younger generation. We can only hope that they do not succeed in their efforts.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that the article was quite misleading and intended to be confusing to the reader. It relies solely on the claim that not all scientists agree that climate change is real, and this is vaguely argued through metaphors and complex examples. I find it strange and quite depressing that an article such as this would be written to confuse the reader into feeling uncertain about the presence of such an alarming issue. The article shifts back and forth from stating that not all scientists agree to claiming that the ones who do agree are invalid and lack enough evidence. This seems to be some sort of desperate attempt to find any little detail that could possibly lead to the conclusion that climate change has no evidence. I agree that the metaphor about a group of scientists touching an elephant and reaching different conclusions is a very poor metaphor to use. It simply holds no truth value in this scenario. In reality, specialists in the scientific field who look at small aspects of climate change are the reasons we have such strong evidence to support it. We have detailed insight into several aspects of climate change instead of one broad view. The article seems to state that this proves a lack of credibility when in reality, it does the opposite.

<br><hr>

I wonder how the population would view the climate crisis if the amount of literature produced was equal on both sides of the argument. What I mean by that is, if proponents of climate change, chiefly scientists, spent as much money on making literature as climate change deniers, and on distributing that literature, would the population view it any differently? The answer is probably yes. 
    <br><Br>
The reality of it is, groups like the Heartland Institute and other conservative think tanks, have done exactly what fossil fuel groups have paid them to do: they have made people doubt the legitimacy of climate change. All the while, fossil fuel industries are continuing to mine, drill, and frack their way to a fortune since the early 1980s. The campaign of disinformation is especially effective when, in this case specifically, you can get a few “scientists” to even agree with you, showing that it is not 97%. No matter what the number now is, people are going to feel lied to and feel like those scientists are perpetrating a fraud against them for their own gain, thus making people feel wronged in some way by those scientists. This literature especially, is very well written, and if someone who did not have extensive knowledge of climate change’s existence read it, they would, at the very least, become skeptical. In the case of conservative think tanks in this arena, skepticality is just as good as denial, because a skeptic is not going to try and fix the status quo when they are not sure if there is a problem to fix.

After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I’m not very pleased with what was said. First of all, starting chapter 1 off with, “The most important fact about climate science, often overlooked, is that scientists disagree about the environmental impacts of the combustion of fossil fuels on the global climate” has me appalled. The most important fact about climate science is most definitely not that scientists disagree on what is happening, it is that the Earth is in a worse state than it has ever been and something is causing it. Whether or not scientists agree on exactly what that cause is or what its impacts are, the utmost important notion about the whole crisis is that whatever it is, it’s not good. Spending time disagreeing among scientists rather than coming together to find the root of the problem is crazy to me. 
    <br><Br>

Another point made in the piece was, “Extensive survey data show deep disagreement among scientists on scientific issues that must be resolved before the man-made global warming hypothesis can be validated.” This also is of great concern because we do not have time for the disagreement to be resolved simply in order to validate a hypothesis that could potentially bring the world to an end. There should be several hypotheses running at once in order to cover all bases and get to the core of the problem. We cannot sit around while scientists argue about who is right or who is wrong. These are the people we look up to for educated advice and they are letting us down with the information presented in this article. Scientists should stick to objectivity and not let feelings of disagreement shadow the actual science behind what is going on no matter what idea it is brought to the table. 
    <br><Br>

I think that we are so concerned on who can find the answer rather than acting on what we know of so far and attempting to fix the problem with anything possible. This crisis is on such a large scale that it is not realistic to rely on one idea to solve the whole thing. A trail and error process should be in place to rule out disagreements instead of simply disregarding them until the scientists come to a verbal resolution.

I totally agree that wasting time to discuss the right and wrong sides of the issue is pointless and is time that could have been put to use to resolve this issue. This book made me think back to how my AP Environmental Science class was taught in high school. I believe that I have an interesting point of view when it comes to how climate change was addressed by my teacher. I had a female conservative, Christian lady as my APES teacher who certainly believes in this crisis and encouraged healthy debates and conversations during class to get young minds wrapped around the two-sided debate and the realities of the consequences. This may be different from your white, liberal male teacher who is not afraid to hint towards his political standing - although it is prohibited to share that information with students. Coming from a similar background as my APES teacher, I could easily relate to the way she described the crisis. Right away, I did not assume that this was a political issue. I just figured that since I was learning about it in a College Board certified class that it was the truth. 

    <br><Br>

I like that you address that there is not just one way to solve this problem. No problem has just one easy fix - especially not one of this scale. This impacts the entire world. Another global, verbal resolution with motivational speakers and testimonies of all ages of those severely affected by climate change would be a positive next step.

After reading the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change”, I learned that there are many disagreements among scientists and elite authorities. Climate change is not as simple as we have seen. Climate crisis is a complex and sophisticated issue that we should, or scientists should consider many sides and perspectives. It is an interdisciplinary subject that requires consideration and insights from many areas, like astronomy, biology, chemistry, economics, and so on. It is a tough issue and requires more and more studies and findings. It is still a long way to investigate and find out the issue and fix it.
    <br><Br>

After watching Ken’s video, I feel nervous. Fossil fuel interests and companies used some methods to minimize the awareness and attention of the climate crisis. Even teachers are misled and unclear, which will directly affect children they teach. In this case, the awareness of climate change and global warming for future generations will reduce. It is problematic and annoying. As we learned from previous lectures, future generations, as well as our generation, are vital in fixing and mitigating climate change. It is important for us and them to realize the severity and urgency of climate crisis first and develop their awareness to protect the Earth and nature in daily life from their young age. This is a critical step and we should really pay attention.

Like what you said, the climate crisis is a complex issue. It is not only about the environment, but also related to economy and politic. In the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change", it mentions Albert Einstein's words: "No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong". I believe most people believe in this "law". So even there is a bunch of evidence that tells you that the climate crisis is caused by human activities, one information about the climate crisis is natural will break other strong evidence. Indeed, the evidence of denying anthropogenic climate crisis is collected as a book and sent to your mailbox.


<br><hr>
I also find it incredibly frustrating the the giant oil companies are birthing this population of stubborn deniers. It's especially frustrating because they lack evidence. They only see what they want to see. They have tunnel vision, which is ironic because it's exactly the claim they're making against the educated scientists. 
    <br><Br>

I also feel nervous. It seems as if these giant corporations have unlimited resources to continue fueling this 'doubt'. These corporations have successfully influenced an entire political party. Now, conservatives associate their party with climate change denial. And as loyal supporters, agree with the lies their corrupt leaders are feeding them. 
    <br><Br>

I don't know how there are people who genuinely believe that there is no climate change. How can they live with themselves knowing that they are feeding the public lies? What world are they leaving for their children? Their children's children? Do they not feel a bit of remorse? 
    <br><Br>

These influential deniers are responsible for murder, destruction of property, thousands of climate migrants, and so many more cpnseequenwes as time goes on. LI hope they end up experiencing first hand the dangers of climate change, because that might be the only thing that'll keep them safe.

When I started reading the book, "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming" I failed to notice the conservative viewpoints being argued about anthropogenic climate change. I originally thought the purpose of the textbook was to give readers a warning about where they get their information from. However, when I continued reading I slowly started to recognize manipulative and condescending nature of this book. 
    <br><Br>

The fossil fuel industry is truly doing its best to entice people, specifically educators, into believing that global warming is not a result of anthropogenic causes but a result of unpredictability. It disgusts me that the fossil fuel industry is targeting educators because educators are one of the most prominent figures in a child’s life. Young students are being fed this false information through their teachers by the fossil fuel industry. I think it is important that we read this book this week in order to recognize how misleading information could be fed to the public so easily. An analogy I made after reading this book is that the Fossil Fuel industry is the Big Brother of our generation. Their purpose is to convince authoritative figures that climate change is not what it is made out to be and these authoritative figures will feed the public with lies which will continue to give the fossil fuel industry its’ power. Their power is currently being used in government, which is why the majority of the population is uncertain what their stance on climate change is. We as the public need to do a better job of figuring out where our information is coming from especially on such important topics that will impact our future.

Before reading this, I had no clue how people could be so adamantly against climate change and confidently deny it. After reading this, I found myself surprised at how well they were able to effectively communicate a climate denying narrative in a way that would be very convincing to those who aren’t educated or in the middle on the issue. While it did not shift my views the slightest bit, I could read it and understand how uneducated Americans are easily susceptible to believe this, especially since they gave out copies to educators to teach students who are literally there to learn the information and have their views shaped. Marita Noon’s message in the beginning was a red flag though while reading it as she made a classic polarizing argument that targeted the base of Americans who feel that climate change is a liberal hoax to take away their lifestyle. As she talked about how climate change believers were trying to take away free speech and American livelihood it really took away all credibility to the whole article as she was so clearly biased. Her attempt at demonizing those who believe in climate change reminded me of an ad that the NRA ran demonizing people who wanted control posing it as an “us vs. them” issue trying to say that those who believe in gun control and climate change are the enemy who are out to hurt people. Seeing how clearly biased this was since it is a product of fossil fuel funding, really angered me when I read that they gave copies to educators and other influential people. It genuinely disgusted me that propaganda from a private industry is allowed to influence childrens’ education. They are taking advantage of the fact that children go to school to learn and shape their views off of what they are taught, since we grow up being told to listen to our teachers and take for granted that whatever they say must be right. If our educators are teaching biased and wrong information then to me, that leaves me very unhopeful. A biology teacher at my high school is a climate change denier who actively taught that perspective to her students. While that may be her, (wrong) opinion, as a teacher she and other educators should be obligated to teach what is the scientifically correct information supported from NASA etc. The future lies with the younger generations and if they are not educated properly on the issue of climate change then we are indeed doomed. States should be making laws to prevent this from happening and keep education safe.

A lot of my values and ideas about things are heavily influenced by my teachers and what I learned from them at a young age. To hear that this text was distributed widely to teachers sounds very manipulative and deceptive to me, as they seem to be trying to get everyone on the same page as them and their agenda. When reading a text like this, a teacher would probably agree with it and even teach his or her students about climate change, being so misinformed. I am sure that there are some valid points to their argument, but those with fossil fuel interests who widely released this book clearly have an agenda and want to make it seem like we can’t really do anything about climate change. In reality, there is a lot we can do as we are really the ones who are causing and aggravating the crisis.

To say that human behavior and action cannot really affect the climate that much is a gross understatement, as it is clear that our actions have only made the climate crisis worse. It puts an idea into people’s minds that there is nothing we can do and that we should just go about our day as if nothing is wrong. And spreading this misinformation around is just so wrong, because I feel like as humans we don’t really know what’s true or not and we easily believe things we are told, whether or not backed by evidence. It’s important that teachers take that extra step to be informed about climate change and learn the true facts about it so that they can inform their students correctly.

One thing I noticed is that there is a lot of time spent on just attacking the scientist and people who believe in climate change. Actually, the whole first three chapters are mostly made up of this. They use a bunch of evidence to show that 97% of scientists that everyone is talking about is not real. They spend so much time on this but don’t give any actual facts as to why climate change isn’t real. They basically just keep reclaiming that climate change activists are trying to fool you and not have you “look behind the curtain.” Except, climate change activists are giving you everything behind the curtain while climate change deniers are the ones hiding the facts behind the curtains. They’re only going back a few years to look at climate change instead of looking at the long run.
    <br><Br>
After finally “convincing” readers these 97% of scientists are fake, they attack the work of many people who wrote about the effect of climate change. They even go as far as calling Oreskes' essay an “opinion essay.” Using facts is not an “opinion” but deniers will go as far as possible to find any way to ignore climate change. Still, throughout this whole time, they haven’t used any facts to actually argue against the claims Oreskes states. They just say she’s not an actual scientist and so you shouldn’t trust her, instead of giving facts as to why her argument is wrong. This reading wasn’t very compelling because they didn’t give any real scientific facts to help their point.

Starting from the first page of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I have to say I am already more than shocked. If even a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Dr. Judith Curry) believes that the NIPCC’s analysis of climate change is “frankly more informative” than the analyses provided by the IPCC, then I am not surprised that far less educated persons are easily persuaded into believing that climate change is non-anthropogenic. Not to mention, it is far easier to believe what we want to believe; it would be nice to think that we are not the ones destroying the earth, and that it is simply due to natural phenomena. So, when there is anything even resembling “scientific evidence” against anthropogenic climate change, people are likely to gravitate toward this reasoning. 
     <br><Br>

I have to say, the “study” did a good job of nit-picking specific statistics that are not necessarily false, but definitely do not indicate that climate change is “natural”. None of the study’s “evidence” actually counteracts the evidence supporting anthropogenic climate change; it just distracts naïve readers because—as I previously mentioned—it is easy to believe what we want to believe, and difficult to believe what we do not. 
    <br><Br>
 
For example, “global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature.” While this may be true, global warming is not the only effect of climate change; and global warming does not affect the entire planet equally. What I mean is that many countries could be experiencing immense rises in temperatures, but other countries may experience temperature drops. Just like global dimming is likely concealing the true extent of climate change, these temperature variations are likely cancelling each other out and making it appear, statistically, that there has been little increase in global temperature. 
 
This “report” solidified my belief that you should:
    <br><Br>
1.     Never believe everything that you read on the internet
    <br><Br>
2.     Do your own research and consider data from multiple reliable resources.
    <br><Br>
I found it extremely unbelievable that “atmospheric levels 15 times greater [than now] existed during the Cambria Period without known adverse effects”, so I decided to do some research; what I found truly discredits the use of this statement as “proof” that CO2 does not contribute to climate change. First of all, the stated value is taken from Robert Berner’s GEOCARB, a well-known model of ancient CO2. GEOCARB has a 10 MILLION-year timestep, and Berner explicitly advises against using his model for “exact values of CO2” due to its inability to account for short-term CO2 fluctuations. So, while CO2 levels were likely very high coming into the Late Ordovician period, the following dip in CO2 levels was likely too brief to register in the GEOCARB model, but low enough to trigger permanent ice-formation. Hence, this strategically-chosen statistic does NOT prove that CO2 levels are independent from climate change; it only proves how simple it is to manipulate data into supporting false statements.

As long as there are equally-reputable scientists on either side of this climate crisis, it is going to be difficult to work as one to mitigate it. Even with the drastic effects of climate change bombarding our daily lives, there will always be people who turn their head and choose to believe the undemanding explanation of the situation. It may be out of laziness, fear, or pure unintelligence. But, whatever the reason, it is only making this crisis become more unmanageable. And, since we cannot even get everyone to BELIEVE that climate change is actually a crisis, we have to get everyone who DOES to work in unison. Even in the best-case scenario, it is hard to have confidence that we will be able to mitigate this crisis.

While reading this paper, I noticed many contradictions in the points the text was making. For example, the text makes a huge point about the bias behind reports from the IPCC and other sources claiming anthropogenic climate change. It claimed that the IPCC's reports were politically based and that reports of anthropogenic climate change also can't be trusted because they are receiving funds from liberal groups trying to push an agenda. This point, to me, was shocking that they even included. This paper is from the Heartland Institute which is in itself funded by those with conservative, fossil fuel interests. In a way, it discredits its own work in this. 
    <br><Br>

Another contradiction I noticed was the idea of so-called climate believers, basing their entire arguments on postulates instead of fact. I found this interesting because rarely did I see any sort of facts disproving climate change. They defined postulates as assuming a statement is true, without independent review. It felt like this piece in itself was one big postulation. It didn't give any new or meaningful ideas to climate change, merely trying to nit pick errors that with further review aren't errors.
    <br><Br>

What troubled me most is that this book had me skeptical at first. Even with what I've already learned in this class, I was confused. Luckily, the more you read this, the easier it was to see through some of their points. It's troubling to hear they sent it out to teachers. The idea that they the Heartland Institute sent out 300,000 for FREE is so sketchy, and makes you think about the depths some will go to benefit themselves. I honestly feel bad for the teachers that received this because it it pretty convincing. It confuses and makes people doubt what is true. It's scary to think of some of the things I've potentially been convinced of with similar rhetoric.

After reading why scientists disagree about global warming, I initially felt convinced by the seemingly evidence-based, data-supported article that global warming is not caused by human activities. For example, the Oreskes’s scientific research which lists opinions from scientists and nonscientists and other professionals. The fact that the fossil affiliates basically use their wealth as mean to influence young children therefore the future of our planet is disgusting and self-serving. 
    <br><Br>
Another thing that shocked me was learning the fact that many K-12 teachers don’t exactly know whether climate change is real or not. In Ken’s previous video, he said that one way to mitigate the climate crisis to for our generation and younger to take control of the planet and make more environmental-preserving policies, but how could we put our hope on the younger generations when they grow up being taught that climate change is not even real. There are obviously a lot of issues like this one to be resolved before we can really make a difference on the climate crisis.

This weeks  reading, “Why Scientists Disagree about Climate Change” was genuinely painful for me to read. Not only was it the least captivating book  I’ve ever read, but it also just made me angry. After reading the first 60 pages, it was clear that the book was targeted towards people  who really only care about the “statistics.”. The first chapter on the climate consensus was the hardest to read. It went on and on about how 97% of the scientist have not actually agreed on anthropogenic climate change. They repeated the same points over and over again about studies being biased and not being credible. The book listed pages with numerous examples of bad studies being presented to support anthropogenic climate change. At this point, I didn’t think I could keep reading. I only had one thought at this point. How are you going to dedicate so much time, energy and money to debunking whether or not 97% of scientists actually believe in climate change when peoples lives and homes are being destroyed because of climate change. We’ve seen islands being submerged underwater because of sea levels rising forcing islanders to immigrate and leave behind a long line of history and culture. More recently, huge and unpredictable wildfires burning down thousands of acres of land and taking numerous lives in California, the Amazon, and more recently, Australia. Weather events that should not be happening in certain seasons or areas  are happening because of climate change. It’s obvious something is going on. The blatant ignorance some people have towards these things sadden me.  I don’t know if anyone else shared these feelings but it was difficult to read this book knowing of the millions of people who have lost their homes and loved ones because of anthropogenic climate change. All the pain and suffering they must have felt because of their losses. My generation has often times been labeled to be overly sensitive and I’m okay with that if it means that we actually have the ability to sympathize for those in need, now and in the future, and step up when we feel something is wrong. The government should have stepped in and resolved the debate years ago. Quite frankly, we’ve been debating climate change for too long.

I am in the same boat as you are because I too find it unbelievable how climate change has been debated about for years yet no significant process has comes from those discussions; the debate is still ongoing. While politicians discuss the reality of the climate change, hundreds of thousands of people are losing their homes or in the worst case scenario they are losing their lives or of those who they love. However, my empathy resonates with those who do not have a voice or anyone to look after their interest, that being wild animals. Unfortunately, animals are the ones receiving the bad end the entire deal, because they are being thrown out of their own home and relocated to a new habitat foreign to them.
<br><hr>
Books like this are still being debated and spread around to this day, leading to more people questioning the actual statistics of the climate crisis. The fact that this book, which I agree was very hard to read and only focused on a few claims, can reach schools and younger audiences who can possibly still believe this, is pretty frightening. If I was a statistics person and read through this not knowing what I know about the climate crisis now, I may have believed this issue to not be such a big deal. The novel provides hundreds of stats and numbers that they believe will contribute to questioning the legitimacy of the climate crisis, but I believe it makes the reading boring. "Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change" doesn't take into account the issues that are currently happening throughout the world, and instead focuses on one false claim. While the writer may have proved that less than 97% of scientists believe in climate change, they don't provide any other reasons, or disprove climate change, for the environmental atrocities occurring more and more frequently.

I found it extremely interesting to read Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming and see the reasoning behind the skepticism. The NPCC did a very convincing job portraying their statistics and arguments, to the point that I was so worried that anyone who had access to this book would believe it immediately. However the sole base of their claim was just finding ways to dispute the studies conducted by climate scientists or committees, instead of actually presenting any reliable research on their own. They disputed the claim that 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real and due to human activity by saying there is no methodological study that proves this, the IPCC was biased in their hypothesis and data collection, and that they were politically motivated. One interesting thing they presented that I never thought of was how scientist’s are optimistic about findings in their own field and pessimistic about other’s. Each scientist, all with different specializations, can contribute different views to the findings behind climate change. One thing the NPCC criticized studies for was not surveying all scientists and only focusing on Earth and climate scientists. They also argue that all future predictions are over precautious and that policy should not be determined on “over precautious”. However I think being over precautious, when it comes to the future of our entire planet and humanity, is a smart thing to do instead of being underprepared. 
    <br><Br>

The part that frustrated me the most was how hypocritical it was. This book’s main argument was that the climate scientists and the IPCC are funded by environmental activists, liberal politicians, the renewable energy industry, etc. The NPCC claims they are a government independent committee, yet the people who published and edited their book, the Heartland Institute, are funded heavily by the fossil fuel industry and work to debunk anything that threatens the free market. I personally liked being able to read the other perspective because I never really understood how anyone could justify disputing climate change, but they did present a lot of facts, different studies, and data in a clear manner. I would like to learn more about climategate and if it actually was as bad as the NPCC is presenting it to be because they make it seem like all the climate scientists were manipulating data, excluding opposing views, and changing their findings to get more funding. The NPCC is extremely hypocritical that the IPCC and alarmists are “brainwashing” children and the media, when they are sending out copies of this book to thousands of K-12 teachers so that it will teach the future generation that climate change isn’t real. These teachers and children need to be educated on the truth of climate change so they do not believe this article.

Whenever I am reading through research articles, something I have learned while being in college is “always consider the source”. I laughed a little bit to myself when I saw that the scientists who don’t believe in the severity of climate change, or that its “natural” and not caused by humans are the same people whose research are being funded by big fossil fuel companies. When companies are funding projects they are in complete control of the information that will be altered and shared from that group. If these scientists disagreed or refused to advocate these ignorant beliefs then they would have their funding pulled. It is sad to see how greedy people can be. Our climate is going to collapse and people easily turn a blind eye and distribute mass amounts of incorrect information all for a paycheck. Referencing Kens response to this reading, when he talks about how these “conservative think-tanks” released the information that "C02 is essential for our earth, that we breathe it out so plants can breathe it in, they call it pollution, we call it life” I just about rolled my eyes. Yes C02 is part of our life and if we were only breathing it out it wouldn’t be this severe of an issue, but that quote is  completely disregarding that C02 also comes from burning fossil fuels, advocated by same fossil fuel companies that were funding that television commercial. It is frustrating to know how many sources are available that are completely tainted because of greed and for the average person trying to do their own research, they would have no idea. Targeting students by offering them “free” resources that contains altered facts puts them at a disadvantage. School is supposed to be a positive experience to learn CORRECT information yet kids are forming their knowledge around corrupted resources, the moral conflict I feel learning about these things upsets me very much. 
    <br><Br>


Something that I found interesting about this book is that whenever they would introduce someone who is advocating for climate change, one of their first steps was to discredit their name. By breaking down reasons for why this person isn’t intelligent enough, they gave themselves and opportunity  to call “bullshit” on their claims. For example, they referred to John Cook as an Australian blogger and followed up with "When he’s not writing about global warming, he’s a professional cartoonist”. By using this method they take the credit away from the actual work that he’s done so you remember things like “blogger, cartoonist, etc..”. Another part of this reading that I found to be interesting is that they mention very few scholars have a mastery of more than one or two disciplines. They go on to label 14+ subjects that someone would need to be mastered in before they would be able to make an accurate claim. Reading this book was frustrating and at this point I was very much over it. I don’t understand how the writers of this book can confidently criticize scientists, respected scholars, and educated people with masters under their belt. Meanwhile their “claims” are being fabricated by some CEO that probably attained a B/A in business, the double standard is unreal.

I completely agree with you on the fact that it is so frustrating to know the truth behind where this denial is coming from. I am lucky enough to have the education to know that the source of an article is as if not more important that the content of the article itself. While reading this book all I felt was anger and frankly disbelief that anyone could write this clearly false information and attach their names to it. About every statement they made had me rolling my eyes. It is hard to believe a thing they say when, if you trace their sponsors, you find out they are being paid to say these things by Fossil fuel companies that are solely interested in making HUGE profits off of destroying the earth. They say in the article that supporting climate change means “massive transfers of wealth from the general public to a small politically connected cabal of climate profiteers” when in reality this is exactly what fossil fuel companies are doing! Supporting the denial of climate change means that these large corporations who are hiding behind politics are able to confuse people so they can continue to make copious amounts of blood money. They also say that climate change supporters are turning this into a political issue, when clearly it is they themselves that are bringing politics into it when they say that being green means forsaking the “american way” of being able to buy whatever you want when you want it no matter the consequences. They also say that people who have denied climate change are being threatened and are not able to speak freely, when in reality scientists that have worked to scientifically prove that human caused climate change exists have received death threats and are being discredited left and right. It seems like they just took all the actual facts that rightly supports activists of climate change and flipped them around and made themselves sound like the victims when in reality they are the criminals. I agree with you and it also makes me extremely sad that in today's world people care more about making money than they do about anything else, even if it means generations to come will be plagued by death and destruction.

In the article, “Why scientists disagree about global warming” is written with the intent to discredit the work of many years of scientific research regarding climate change. This article spent a significant amount of time also discrediting the IPCC. This article claims that there is no scientific concusses about climate change. I found that this article gave very little information and scientific support as to why there is not a concuss regarding the well-known fact that 97% of scientist agree that global warming is man made. Instead this article spends a significant amount of time claiming that scientist that support climate change are alarmist and that the IPCC is self-serving and biased. This article repeatedly states the same conclusions over and over again. This includes, that scientist in support of climate change don’t have proper knowledge from many different fields, thus they cannot correctly conclude that climate change is real. They claim there is a disagreement over how to interpret this data. That scientist and the IPCC are all biased, that they are ignoring the null hypothesis. Finally, that they are self-serving and thus not creditable because they are politically driven. I was not surprised that they made these claims. However, I was surprised at the amount of effort they spent discrediting scientists and the IPCC through a well-known propaganda technique known as Name Calling. Name-calling is a propaganda technique that intendeds to invoke fear and form a negative opinion about a person or group. This can be seen when they describe John Cook as a “wacky Australian blogger”. This was an effort to cripple his credibility. Another example is how they continually call climate change activist, as “Alarmist” while those that do not believe in climate change is “realist”. I found it shocking that they continually pull this tactic throughout the article. 
    <br><Br>

 After reading some of the reviews online I noticed that the comments that disagree with the article all were rated with a one star. While those comments that are in support of the paper had a five star rating. This surprised me that so many people are in support of the claims made in this paper. One shocking review came form someone that claimed to be a high school science teacher. This is extremely alarming to me considering that they were obviously biased. For a science teacher to obviously be in support of denying climate change, how can you teach students both sides when you are so obviously one sided? The only way we are going to change the planet is by educating the youth. It’s upsetting to see that teachers, who hold such a vital importance in the life of children, are biased.

I feel the same way. This book is incredibly manipulative and, therefore, dangerous to those who are not well educated on the climate crisis. Over and over, the book selects one scholar or scientist to discredit and then spends paragraphs critiquing their findings. Furthermore, they spent most of the book attacking the IPCC for being biased and self-serving. While this is obviously problematic on its own, what makes it even worse is the clear hypocrisy that the Heartland Institute displays with this publication. They themselves  are biased and self-serving. They provide very little evidence to support their claims and when they do, the resources are either written by members of their own organization or taken out of context from a credible source. This tactic, by itself, is harmful. Someone may read through a passage and be skeptical, but the passages are immediately followed by a lengthy list of sources; if someone does not look closely at the list, they may begin to feel that this book is credible. 
    <br><Br>

After reading through a number of Amazon reviews for this book, it was clear that many people fell for the manipulation in this book. As you mention, the few one star reviews that I read were people who knew the book was full of false and biased claims. However, there were far more positive reviews and all of them applauded the Heartland Institute for this publication. It is quite unsettling to think that there are large groups of people who have read this book, taken it to be a credible source and then spread its message to their children, students and others. Then, to hear Ken say that roughly 10 million children could be exposed to this book unsettled me even more. 
    <br><Br>

Manipulative groups like the Heartland Institute are probably one of the top few reasons that large-scale action against climate change hasn't happened yet.
<br><hr>

I agree with both of you. Even though we only had to read the first few chapters, you can instantly tell the author's bias throughout the reading. If someone with little knowledge on global warming were to read this, they'd be extremely misinformed. Much like you said, I can see the multiple times in the book where the author chooses one person's work to dissect and how they bluntly criticized their work. Multiple times, the Heartland Institute displays examples of hypocrisy in their book when talking about scientists strongly displaying biases in their research and findings and the little to no evidence that's supposed to back up their arguments. In addition, they want to talk about scientists only citing works and people that would benefit them even if it were incorrect, and yet, here they are doing the same thing. I find it funny how dumb they look writing this book because they're literally just as bad as the people they're talking bad about in their book. This is exactly why some people/organizations should not be given the chance to write and publish a book.

The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” is terrifyingly effective for a number of reasons. First of all, the author is very careful about his tone and the way that he portrays his information to his audience. By using an even and almost calm tone, the author portrays that he is level-minded, rational, and not worried. This is undoubtedly to make climate change alarmists, who do often use fear and urgency to get their points across, seem irrational and exaggerated. The calm tone also helps to put the reader at ease and ensure the reader that they don't have to worry about climate change. The second reason that this book is so terrifying is that it very effectively plants the seed of doubt, which is all the skeptics want. I, as an educated college student who completely believes in and is scared of anthropogenic climate change, began to question everything I thought. When a book writes that you are brainwashed and tells you SEEMINGLY logical reasons for thinking that, the doubt begins to creep in. I was embarrassed by my moments of doubt until I read the comments on this video. This is the scary part: if we as college students with some background information and a pretty much solidly formed opinion are questioning anthropogenic climate change for even a second, imagine everyone reading this book who has no background information on how skewed this perspective is. Imagine the children who are exposed to readings such as this one. The skeptics are effectively targeting an audience in their formative years quickly and effectively and it is very dangerous.

I agree with you that tone and word choice are a major indication to how the book was written: to bring rise of skepticism and confusion but portray confidence. By using language that sounds informed, he builds a tone of credibility. By adding the rhetorical question, “Why bother?” it builds a sense of shared understanding on the topic. The tone and confidence are techniques used to persuade an audience, so of course someone who isn’t informed on all of the facts would believe in the information presented in the book even though it comes from the Heartland Institute.
     <br><Br>

Another tactic the authors use to build credibility is by formatting the book to appear as if it contains factual information. There are references to other sources and the book sites well-known institutions like the IPCC. If you just skim through the formatting, it appears as a peer-reviewed book that contains well-thought out and crafted chapters. This formatting takes a lot of doubt away that the book would not be dependable. It is scary to think about the lengths climate deniers go to get people to agree with their opinions, and with the written language and formatting of the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming?” it is a perfect example on how deniers get people who are unsure about climate change to think the climate crisis is fake

I actually really struggled to read “Why Scientists Disagree on Climate Change” but not because it was hard to understand but because it was so obviously wrong. The whole time it felt like I was losing brain cells. 
    <br><Br>
It was just really frustrating to read

    <br><Br>

First of all, they place this book as one worthy of talking about Climate Change, but then you look at the authors and realize that they don’t even have the proper credentials to make any claims on the topic. Even the reviews praising their previous works have been from people or scientists who again have nothing to do with climate science. If they have no real background in climate science, how are they to know what the data show or that the climate scientists who made them are wrong. So right off the back, everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. Secondly, the way they actually approach the “rebuttals” is so blatantly biased. The speaker seems to be neutral but when you really look at what they’re saying, you can see how skewed their view truly is. Instead of actually talking about the data, the majority of the time, the speaker just goes after the scientist but villainizing and criticizing them. Naomi Oreskes is painted out to be a socialist who is incapable of providing accurate information about how scientists feel about climate change when in reality she is a well-respected historian of science teaching at Harvard. They also relied on words alone and rarely provided any real statistics or proof of their reasoning. What I thought was funny was that they claimed that their fellow deniers were being attacked by climate scientists when it has been proven time and time again that it is the climate deniers who send literal death threats to anyone who speaks out about climate change! Even the fact that they’re attacking scientists in the book shows their hypocrisy. They even claim that the “truth” about climate change has been censored and that climate deniers rarely have a voice in social media, but again we know that is completely wrong. Most of the people who ever get screen time to talk about climate change are those deniers and rarely do we ever see any real in-depth look at natural tragedies taking place around the world that were caused or fueled by climate change. Take for instance our ignorance on the extent of the paradise fire. Thirdly, their claims just really don’t make any sense. They claim that there is no connection between the world warming up and drought. If it’s getting hotter that means everything will be drier and there will be less moisture, so clearly a drought will follow. Or they even go as far to say that the world warming has no connection to natural disasters. Hurricanes are started by warm waters, fires are started by high winds and dry land, floods are started by rising sea level, the sea level rises because of ice melting, ice melting is because the world is getting too hot and other natural disasters follow a similar pattern. There are still more problems with the book but for now, I think this is enough to show their incapability to add anything meaningful to the climate change debate.

    <br><Br>

What is truly disturbing is the fact that they’re sending these books to teachers. These teachers are one of the most trusted adults in a child’s life so by aiming at them, they mean to brainwash the children. This book is purposely made to sound convincing so a normal teacher with no background or real knowledge about climate change will obviously struggle with discerning the credibility of the book. If the teachers become unsure of the climate crisis then they will be less likely to teach their kids about it for fear that it might actually be false. Or even worse, they may teach kids that the climate crisis isn’t real. If that becomes the case, then it will be harder to convince them later on, creating more climate deniers. 
    <br><Br>
It just goes to show what disturbing lengths fossil fuel interests are willing to go.

I completely agree. This article was painful to give the time of day to. And sadly I think your point about the authors not having credentials would go unnoticed by many readers, ( if I hadn't specifically been looking for it, I probably would have missed it too.) It is disgusting how the article discusses looking at all the data with an "open minded" kind of attitude, but they are so biased! I hate that they sent their book to K-12 educators for free! This is obviously a form of brain washing- they are trying to convince CHILDREN not to believe people who are trying to SAVE THE PLANET for the CHILDREN??? Make that make sense!? I think that the information that a lot of the people who work on combating the climate action scientists also worked for the tobacco industry is alarming and also very telling. When looking at the tobacco aspect, you can pretty clearly see that these people are not looking out for your best interest, but it angers me because with the issue on climate change, these people are pretending to be on your side. They are creating a conspiracy that they are protecting you from evil liberal scientists who just want money, when in reality there is the clearest of links between the people working in the fossil fuel industry and fighting climate action for money.

Hi! I also found “Why Scientists Disagree on Climate Change” a struggle to read and for the same reasons. I just found myself completely frustrated as I was reading. Page after page I was reading false facts and evidence that tore apart the credibility of scientists, and studies. At this point I had to stop and think why do people find this believable? The problem is if people don't know what exactly climate change is/don't have strong knowledge about it, this book could be convincing for some. Even if it is not convincing it could definitely be confusing. Even just a few weeks ago before taking this class, I would have been more susceptible to believing what this book had to say. This is why I think it is wrong to be sending these books to teachers especially. They have the ability to influence many more children than most people. As kids we go to school and we learn and we don't go home and fact check our educators, so when a teacher is told to tell their students that climate change is a two-sided argument or just don't say anything at all because they are confused the children are going to be affected by this.  Like both, you and Ken said a teacher is one of the most trusted people in a child's life so it is important that our educators are rightfully informing them of the climate crisis. I personally think that educating kids is a hard enough job, and when you are given information that leaves you confused it is only harder to identify what you should be teaching. Like you said in the worst case a teacher could say that climate change is not happening which would affect how those children respond to it in the future.

Going into this week's reading blind, the first chapters in "Why Scientists Disagree With Climate Change" were very effective in making me rethink what I had learned about the climate crisis in the past couple weeks. The meticulous citations after every section and deceptively neutral tone of the narrator were  effective in swaying my opinions about the truths of global warming, and I can definitely see others being influenced as well. I found the book's arguments that scientists have found that the Earth's temperature consistently varies plus or minus 5 Celsius, and the accusation that IPCC is a largely political organization to be the most well thought out. I can definitely see a fluctuation of Earth's temperature to be normal in the planet's long lifespan, and if I didn't know otherwise, I might've been convinced. However, a little research and it is easy to find that the current rate of global temperature rise is unprecedented. On the other hand, I know that most people, such as children or busy adults, are too preoccupied with other things than to spend time on fact-checking a book. As for the second argument, it is true that IPCC is a political organization; it is political in the sense that it uses politics to influence a restoration of a crisis. Whether you like it or not, politics is inevitable when dealing with a global crisis such as this one. While yes, the IPCC's existence relies on a consensus that global warming does in fact exist so it does benefit from influencing others, this influence does not harm the planet in any way. While attempting to paint the IPCC in a negative light, it hypocritically ignores the harm that the fossil fuel industry brings to the environment.

Viewing Ken's introduction to the film reaffirmed my stance on the climate crisis. I hope those who are deceived by fossil fuel corporation propaganda can discover the truth in the issue. The fact that this book is being sent to K-12 teachers is crazy to me; it really cements the fact that there exists anonymous individuals in the world who wield enormous amounts of power, and will do anything to keep their wealth, going so far as to lie to masses and allow the planet to slowly decay.

The future of our Earth will be decided by whoever has the most pocket change. And that sucks. Reading this book was frustrating, because it was making attempts to discredit the facts that we know to be true: that anthropogenic climate change is going to have destructive effects on our Earth. This book, any many others like it that attempt to deny climate change, are funded by think tanks which are in turn funded by fossil fuel companies who will pay any amount to ensure their industry stays afloat. This book in particular was sent unsolicited to hundreds of thousands of educators, which, due to classroom sizes, will become the basis of education for millions of students. The money of these fossil fuel companies is deciding how the future leaders of our country are educated, and if these companies continue their efforts, future generations will grow up not knowing the imminent threat that climate change poses to our planet.
    <br><Br>
 My generation and the generations after it need to be the ones to curb the emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In order to do that, we need to vote politicians into office who will support laws that will do that. However, if the leaders of fossil fuel companies continue their strong efforts to misguide students, there will not be enough people to make those votes happens. There will be too many climate skeptics who will have learned from school that climate change is still a debate. It is not. Anthropogenic climate change has been studied and proven, and its effects are already affecting us now. Our future depends on how future generations vote, and their votes are being bought by fossil fuel companies.

I completely agree. It's one thing to firmly believe in something and take action and bring awareness to others, but it's those who have money who have the direct ability to make those changes immediately. Many of these powerful factors are the ones directly contributing to climate change; profiting off of oil digging amongst other things just to make sure money keeps flowing in. What my fear is, is that our generation will do the most they can do be environmentally friendly, but will never outweigh the effects of these big companies denying anthropogenic climate change/ignoring the deadly outcomes of their actions. It seems that the individual is greatly disadvantaged in comparison to these companies. Not just companies that participate in oil drilling, but those who distributed this book to schools in an attempt to sway the students and maybe even teachers into thinking that climate change isn't a real thing. It's utterly appalling at how people are doing the most to ignore or deny climate change. They ignore or deny that the only place habitable for life is being ruined by our actions for selfish, monetary reasons.  Education is the start of combatting climate change, but it seems hopeless since it appears that many do not care to be educated or believe in what the facts and evidence prove.

It was beyond surprising to read the first few chapters of this book and see how convincing it was. If I were to know nothing about climate change or was a very impressionable person, I would almost blindly trust this book based on how convincing and scientific language sounded. While reading the book, it was almost comical how certain they seem about their argument and made climate change seem like it’s so silly.
     <br><Br>

The book did bring up a few good points such as pointing out that Oreskes might have a major flaw in their findings on scientists’ research and conclusions on climate change. The fact that they pointed this out makes me keep in mind that I shouldn’t take all research/studies as flawless pieces of analysis and that even though it supports what I believe, I should be more wary of sources and the process of obtaining the results.
     <br><Br>

It’s frustrating that the Heartland Institute mailed out 300,000 copies of their latest edition to teachers all across America. What’s even more frustrating is that if these teachers were to teach their students this material, then millions of American youth will become easily swayed into doubting or all in all denying climate change, just because of this incredibly persuasive writing.

I really enjoy reading detailed arguments. I think that arguments can always go both ways (if prior bias does not exist) and I do think that anyone can make the case on any side. I particularly enjoyed the mass amounts of statistics that were thrown at the readers to help convince people that climate change is not as severe as many think it is nor has it reached a consensus that many believe it has reached. The way in which the authors present their argument is very intricate and expansive. However, when I see an argument that is backed by pure statistics, I always take it with a grain of salt. As Benjamin Disraeli said, “There are three types of lies - lies, damn lies, and statistics.” 

     <br><Br>

The way in which the authors of the text word their argument makes it seem as if the takers of the survey were unqualified or irrelevant to the discussion at hand. They also tried to tear down the fact that there is a near - if not complete - consensus on the topics of climate change, including the man-made impacts on climate change. However, what I find the most ironic - and in all honesty, hilarious - is the idea that climate change is a “political agenda.” To say that politicians continue to push climate change through funding, publicity, and sheer support is a little funny. I say this because they are naive to make these claims and refuse to look the other way; they deny and point the finger at the opposition when they are playing the same game. Fossil fuel companies and conservative think tanks, or CTTs, continue to feed into the propaganda that climate change is not as serious as it is made to be. What I find hard to argue are the visuals. Today, we see more natural disasters; more fires, hurricanes, tornadoes. Everything is at more intensity. The temperature has increased every year over the past half-decade. They are simple. Facts. To preface, I am no expert in climate change, global warming, environmental science, meteorology, etc. However, I do not need to be an expert to look with my own two eyes, see what is happening to our planet, and deduce that our planet is changing. There are no statistics, no agenda, no propaganda, that can change what I see. If the evidence, if the predictions, if the increase in temperature, if all the statistics in the world are not believable, then I can tell you what the opposition against climate change does not have that the people that SEE that climate change exists do. There are people suffering. There are ecosystems burning down or melting away. There are landmasses, islands, and homes that are slowly deteriorating or being swallowed by the rapid rise in ocean sea level. There are environmental refugees that are forced out of their homes. There is a fight for natural resources and the debate to enter the arena of climate change. 
     <br><Br>


If the numbers are not convincing, then let your eyes do the believing. I guarantee you that your own two eyes will not fail you.

I'm also under the impression that arguments can indeed go both ways, and a case can be made on any side. While I absolutely believe in anthropogenic climate change, I can also believe that there is likely room for debate in discussing the extent of its impact. 
     <br><Br>
I was likely more convinced by the arguments in the reading than you were, probably also because I don't have the scientific knowledge to determine the validity of any climate scientist's claims. However, I think it is easy to see a clear "political agenda" behind the reading itself, even though it ironically argued that climate scientists also had an agenda. Climate science is overwhelmingly more costly to fossil fuel interests than the other way around, so it makes sense that fossil fuel interests would craft these arguments so convincingly and carefully. 
     <br><Br>

In this era of fake news it's honestly so difficult to know what's right and wrong, and that's what has complicated this issue more than it already is. I hope that, as you said, people believe what they see with their two eyes.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. Although the book presents data and statistics, it is very easy to pick and choose data that supports their claims as well as what is more convenient for them. Such as one of their findings I recall being that the earth has not warmed in the last 18 years when in fact, only Ventura County has reached 2.6 degrees celsius increase the last decade. It is ironic, that in this modern world we live in, science and scientists are being held in doubt. As we have seen in lecture, scientists have warned us about the effect of greenhouse emissions on earth since decades ago; however, past generations did not do anything. Nowadays, we have more resources and even more knowledge about climate change and the crisis that comes along with it, but we are still not moving forward with bills that regulate greenhouse emissions and make big fossil fuel corporations take responsibility for their acts. This book is just one of many that seeks to convince people that climate change is false, but you are right there is nothing more credible than what we see. This is our reality, and no matter where you look, people are dying of heat strokes, poverty within underdeveloped countries is growing, the Arctic is melting, sea levels are rising, and many more things that are happening, no predictions, not in the future, it is already happening. 
     <br><Br>



I would also like to add that education is, in fact, a huge part of this debate. The influence that teachers have over their students is very important, children should be taught the truth of the matter. New generations have no choice, but to face the truth of what has been done by past generations and which sadly have to be fixed by us and future generations.
<br><hr>
There is always reason behind madness and this reason is typically not always truthful. From climate change to vaccinations, there has always been people that make up their own statistics to make their argument more convincing. The truth is that statistics make or break a lot of points, we rely on statistics to back up our arguments and feeding false statistics breaches a whole new level of reader-writer distrust. Disraeli is correct but the truth is that this is not the type of relationship we should want established because how are we supposed to trust anything, ever? 
     <br><Br>

The reading did try to tear down the climate change topic but truthfully how could one ever believe that the entire climate change issue is made for politics. This idea really is laughable and completely ridiculous, the pot calling the kettle black is exactly what I think of that situation. How can one say climate change is only a made up of political scheme but make up lies that climate change does not exist for the sake of politics? Climate change deniers are only exemplifying that confirmation bias is real. We believe what we want to and that is the end of the argument.  Yet when people want to ignore science that is when real harm is being done, not just to our Earth but to us. So much change has been occurring and yet denial is not just a river in Egypt. Even when people see what has become of the Earth is when the problem will be too far.  People who have the power to change climate change are ignoring action and only causing climate change to be worst. Honestly, the people who create the most climate change are the ones that will be least effected because the poor will suffer first. Living away from all the suffering makes the the suffering seem nonexistent. You speak truth, but the death of the coral reefs and extinction of animals do not change the opinion of the people with the most sway. People will not truly care until the issue changes their life, but when the truth finally does hit their life all the poor would have already suffered. This truth is right in front of them, but the truth does not matter if you have a blindfold on.

<br><hr>

I agree. I believe the mass amount of statistics were used as a tactic to fool the audience into thinking the text was credible. Unfortunately, I think this is a tactic that would be successful in fooling some people. Climate change deniers are always looking for ways to confuse and sway the public. I found it interesting that they called climate scientists claims "deeply flawed," when it takes very little to see the already damaging effects of climate change. Personally, I think it is astonishing that people can still deny climate change, especially with all of the effects we are experiencing today, such as more powerful storms and more dangerous fires. I agree with this comment on the fact that people are denying the undeniable visuals. Freak weather events are occurring left and right. What will it take for people to admit the change? I am even more confused at the fact that some of the people who deny climate change call themselves scientists. 
     <br><Br>

I believe that in the education system, we need to focus on how imperative it is that we change our lifestyle. If these kids grow up understanding and being familiar with ways they can live their lives to help the climate, I believe that will make a difference. Half of k through 12 teachers do not touch on the subject of climate change. We must act before the climate change deniers have anything to do with the way it is taught. If teachers are confused on the subject, then students are more likely to be too. The way it is taught will likely effect how the next generations act on it, because it can be taught as a big deal, or it can be taught as an opinion. Climate change is not a "two-sided argument." The authors of the text try and take away the validity of the near consensus on anthropogenic climate change. However, it is an undeniable fact that humans are changing the environment, and I believe one must either be ignorant or lying to themselves if they say they don't see it. It is heartbreaking to know that some people care about their personal wealth or success of a company more than they do the lives of everyone on the entire planet.

I agree with you. It does seem like that in the book the data and evidence presented to us are seen as biased. Some of the facts do seem like real evidence that can be supported but there is a great amount of “data” and “evidence” that backs up their claims to make it seem like they are right. There isn’t much room to argue for both sides of the case presented.
     <br><Br>

I find it odd that in one of their case studies they mentioned how that only Venture has warmed up to 2.60 C. How has only Ventura warmed and not the surrounding cities or counties? How is it that they are ignoring the fact that the polar ice caps are melting due to a rise in temperature because of humans? The book really demonstrated how people make up their own facts, statistics, and try to evade the real evidence at hand. Unfortunately, many people are to blind to realize that these are false statements and they end up believing what they read. Most of these people probably only read this one source and not do their research and look at many other sources and sites to make sure the facts are correct.

In the article of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” this article talks many different ideas about before articles. This article mainly argues that some of experts think the main reason of global warming is not human activities. And big majority of teacher do not really know how to protect the environment and stop crisis of climate change.
     <br><Br>
From my perspective, if a teacher wants to teach students environmental study, knowing about the harm of human activities to the environment and convey to students is a basic requirement. They need to know the specific actions about protecting the environment. Also, they have responsibilities to let more students to know the severity of global warming.
     <br><Br>
In my opinion, many reasons can cause and exacerbate the global warming. However, human activities definitely are a main reason that no one can deny. Although, human activities have not very large influence on global warming, we still need to put all of our efforts to protect our planet.

The book does argue that experts disagree on anthropogenic climate change. The Heartland institute published this piece, they are funded by fossil fuel companies. There are oil and gas interests in play by publishing such information. The idea that global warming is propaganda is the strategy by fossil fuel companies to delay a response to the issue and hence continue growing. The Heartland institute states the opposite of what the current climate crisis shows; a warmer world will see milder weather patterns. A warming of 2°C or more as we know has detrimental effects but according to the book, there would be no harm from this warming because many areas of the world would benefit from or adjust to climate change.
     <br><Br>

The Heartland institute was very strategic with whom they chose to share their book with. They targeted policymakers, teachers, and children as the audience. A lot of politicians, mostly republican are already climate change deniers because it suits their monetary pockets. By sending out this book to politicians it only serves as confirmation bias, siding them even further to denial of climate change. Teachers in society provide young minds with the education they need in order to be successful members of the world they live in. Educators at primary and secondary schools study subjects such as basic math, science, and history. These individuals are not experts in a certain field of study. Teachers in most cases teach material that the school district requires of them to do. When it comes to the topic of climate change young minds are not informed and therefore rely on the knowledge of older individuals. This book caused chaos because children were being taught by their educators, the people they look at for information, that nature not humans was causing climate change. Climate change skepticism then arises in the minds of American children. Young people will not take action if they deem no action necessary.

I am really confused about why so many people do not believe in the climate crisis. So, when I read the book, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I am not surprised that many scientists disagree about global warming. Their writing is misleading and confusing to some extent. They think that “The most important fact about climate science, often overlooked, is that scientists disagree about the environmental impacts of the combustion of fossil fuels on the global climate.” But just like Professor Ken said in the video, they are experts in one particular area and lack other specific data or knowledge to determine whether global warming is happening now or not. Then they state that “Fundamental uncertainties arise from insufficient observational evidence.” This means that there is no direct or enough evidence to show that global warming is unusual. However, I disagree with this point. In our daily life, we can see what happened now in our earth. Thousands of hundreds of people lost their homes by sea-level rise, and polar bears float in cracked ice due to the melting glaciers. Moreover, more and more unusual extreme natural disasters are happening now. We cannot ignore all of those facts to support global warming. From my perspective, I believe that global warming is happening now, and we should admit that humans are responsible for it. What we should do is put into action to protect our environment instead of denying our mistakes.

Education is absolutely important if we want to combat climate change, however, one might say that it is a double edged sword. Not only can it be used for good, to spread the seriousness of climate change and its possible consequences , but it can also create a climate of doubt and uncertainty. As we have come to learn, institutes like Heartland, are being funded by the fossil fuel industry to promote this climate of doubt. How then, do we begin to combat these large institutions that want the public to remain in a cloud of uncertainty? What gives the fossil fuel industry power, are their connections and control of the government. From local governments, to senators, to the president - the fossil fuel industry is slowly but surely securing their grasp on government. I was surprised to learn about the Heartland Institute mailing 300,000 books to middle schools. They're trying to indoctrinate kids from a young age to doubt the reality of climate change. I ask myself, to what end. 
     <br><Br>
These climate denielism promoters are anything but stupid, they know exactly what they are doing and at what cost. But if I ever had the chance to talk to one of these people, I would sit them down and ask - to what end? Is it really worth it? It truly saddens me, the extent of human greed and selfishness. The human race is said to be the most complex creatures on the planet, perhaps the universe, yet everyday that passes I start to believe that our intelligence is but a downfall of our creation. Our intelligence is vast in many things, yet when it comes to being unselfish and working together- we struggle. Americans are being misled by these massive campaigns. Do they not realize that eventually all the harm they are causing will reach them at some point. Perhaps not at first, but it will catch up to them and until then will they realize the grave mistake that they have committed.

Before reading this book, I expected it to be similar to the film that we also watched this week; I was surprised to find something that was actually well written and well planned. It was not solely a piece that spoke about why climate change is a myth without facts to back it up -- there was a great deal of research and thought put into this; however, I could not disagree with its content more. Their argument is that articles containing the "97% of scientists agree" fact is inaccurate, but how do we know that the information that they are giving us is reliable? If showing that the articles proving the climate crisis is happening because of human action, it would probably be pretty easy to debunk facts in this book as well. 

     <br><Br>

And the fact that people actually believe what is being said throughout the book is outrageous. People are so skeptical about trusting research that validate a rise in temperature, but it is not difficult for them to immediately agree with what the reading states. It is also absurd to me that people are sending this out to K-12 teachers to try and get children to believe that climate change is false. Disregarding the fact that I do not agree with the author of this book, it is morally incorrect to try to influence kids in this way; everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but something this controversial should never be taught in a school setting. Student should be able to form their own opinion without the influence of teachers.

     <br><Br>

Even though it is completely absurd to me that people do not believe that climate crisis is occurring, I do think that it was a good idea to read part of this book. In order to form an argument against the other side of the issue, we need to know what they are going to talk about. If we do not know what they will propose, there is no way to counter it.

You are totally right. It was actually good to read this article not because to make ourselves to believe in what the authors said but just to have a look on how people will have such claims that saying climate change is a myth. Throughout the chapters that we have read, it keeps saying a lot about how the 97% of the scientist agrees with climate change is inaccurate and it gives a lot of different citations or “evidence” from others’ writing or research to challenge those who believe in climate change and to make sense of what they are saying about the myth. However, I do have the same feeling like you have when I am reading this book because even though everything seems right, but they are not strong argument to make us as a reader to believe in what they say instead. All I see from their argument is how they keep trying to disagree with climate change and saying this is wrong and that is inaccurate; but on the other hand, the evidence they give to support their own argument is very repetitive and seems very bias and they are not very strong argument to be used against those research believe in climate change. And yes, it doesn’t hurt to know about the opinions from both sides because no matter which side we choose to believe, we should know what the argument of both sides have and make our own critical thinking. But this book seems to disagree with everything the other side said and claim they are all wrong, but insist only with the things they think are right which I don’t even think they are confident enough in defending what they are saying.


<br><hr>
completely agree with you. The evidence that is given throughout this book has no backbone whatsoever. It seems as though they are just giving their own opinions with weak facts and hoping that people will believe them. Ken also discussed in class the fact that most of the articles utilized for evidence are not reliable sources; most of the evidence that was inserted into the book were from sources that were written by climate change deniers. This proves your statement about how their evidence seems extremely biased and repetitive. The only true facts that they used are from highly regarded sources, but the authors of this book misinterpret them and use them in a different light than what the source author's meant. Overall, there is no real truth behind the claims of these deniers.

I have always heard of the saying, “97% of scientists agree…” and always believed it because it is, you know, science. You usually don’t question something that’s already been researched, especially when it deals with factual evidence that scientists/researchers have concluded. When first reading this information, it is easy to see how some opinions get swayed because their argument also seems truly factual. I actually questioned whether this fact was true after they stated how “the 98% figure often attributed to their survey refers to the opinions of only 79 scientists” whom of which were all climate scientists. When they actually did the experimental research, the bias was not there as only 5 percent self-identified as climate scientists, and the consensus was at a much larger scale (10, 257 scientists). I kind of believed it, but it immediately gets rebuked when you understand who is actually behind the book and who they are targeting it to. The Heartland Institute, which is the biggest climate-denying organization in the U.S. (and is also funded by the fossil fuel lobby) significantly preys on younger children because that is the only audience they can make an impact on. It is grossly infuriating that they have to solicitly send thousands of copies onto innocent children just because their belief of entitledness is not processing. It simply is just not clear to me how you can see California up in flames and still say that, “nature, not human activity, causes climate change.”
     <br><Br>
Climate scientists are of course biased– much like anyone on this Earth, they shift more towards their beliefs not only because of their strong views, but because stating your opinion on a topic so debatable leads to jumps in careerism, grant-seeking, political views, and confirmation bias. All press is good press in this case; whether you deny that climate change is real or a man-made disaster, those who are receiving the most attention are those that deny the facts. They especially direct more attention onto themselves when discouraging or insulting the most loved in the public eye– and in this case, it was President Barack Obama. The book starts with a debunking of his career because of a problem he and most other people believe is true, “Climate change is the greatest threat facing mankind”, and continues on to slander his choice of words because ISIS should rather be known as the detrimental evil. Of course, it is easy to attack the most liberal leader that has shown support for everything that climate crisis deniers most likely support (abortion, immigration, etc.). The blame is easily put onto those who are in the line of attack; and in this case, it is the first black president who opposes everything the climate deniers believe in. The argument of not having a ‘consensus’ is frankly just a ploy to reel people in to their beliefs, and it is infuriating how their stark beliefs are even up to debate.

I am very much like you in the sense that I would often believe almost any claim if it was said with a stat like, 97% of scientists. I knew that it was not my expertise and that would never be so I just always left it to the scientists to tell me what to believe as fact and what to not take as serious. It was not until recently where I now begin to question everything and do research to see whether the sources used are reliable or biased. In all honesty regarding the climate crisis there are not many unbiased takes on this issue. At this point it seems to either be severely bad or not happening at all. That being said I looked into the sources of this reading and as Ken pointed out in class a huge contributor to this book, The Heartland Institute, is the biggest climate change denying organization. I can see why how they target younger children into reading this kind of article can be frustrating to you and unfortunately that is what it has come to in order to continue to live their unnecessarily luxurious lives. It is no surprise that they are heavily funded by fossil fuel lobby as they are trying to teach young people that what they are doing is good and is not harming the planet. I must not lie this reading was well written and at points made me consider certain aspects that I had not yet thought about starting with the environmental research with the scientists, but again they are pushing out this book as it benefits themselves rather than the environment. Although a book that is well written with many pieces of statistical evidence to support their point can be convincing it is always something you must take in easily enough to think it through. My biggest issue with the reading is that the book described that the climate crisis is just a political agenda to gain control. This as well as how they said that global temperatures were hardly rising. These two stuck out to me because this will eventually be a matter of life and death. It is hard for me to believe that it would be a political agenda when so many people have gotten onboard and are trying to find more environmentally friendly ways of doing things. As for the temperatures not rising is absolutely absurd considering the fact that it has truly been proven otherwise. It does not make sense to me that someone would say something like that when states like California and Florida have witnessed climate change issues first hand over the past decade or so seeing natural disasters like no other ever before. 
     <br><Br>


Although this reading made me consider several things and even question some of my own views I still can stand by what I believed before this reading. I have always believed that there are always two sides to every story and I still do as I feel it is fair to strongly consider both sides of an argument. Not only do you learn more, but you also grow as an individual. To me there is no better way to approach hot topics of debate by visiting and understanding both sides.

I think it’s a part of life to trust certain things said, depending on who says it. We trust these people and their words because we don’t have the time or experience that they have said to come up with the same conclusion. We tend to trust teachers to teach us the correct information because that’s their career that they have spent years establishing. Who are we to question it? We tend to trust when people tell us not to go to a certain place or do a certain thing because we don’t want to face similar repercussions that they might have had. So when we hear the saying  “97% of scientists agree…”, we can think that it’s something we can trust because a majority of scientists are on the same page and have spent the time coming to a similar solution. But the conservative think tanks (CTT) use this trust against us. That’s why when I read about their experimental research in the reading I also kind of believed what they were saying at first too. The thought came into my mind and then it quickly decimated as soon as I remembered what I was actually reading. It’s honestly kind of terrifying that these CTTs can convince us so easily on a topic this life threatening, it makes me wonder about all of the other things they are hiding behind our backs. I do agree that the Heartland Institute preys on younger children because they can make an impact on them. They can make an impact on many people, but children are some of the most vulnerable and naive so they are using that to their advantage. And it infuriates me as well knowing that they have to send copies to school teachers in order to trap these child, in a sense, and try to persuade them to think otherwise. And sadly it’s working because we have them, and other Americas, believing that these fires and other weather events are simply the norm. Yes, fires have been happening for hundreds of thousands of years, however, they have never been this intense or damaging in our history! But they are blinded to that fact because of these CTTs. I like how you mention how easy it is to put blame someone in the line of attack because it is so true. It’s very easy to attack people like President Barack Obama. The climate change deniers knew that they could attack him not only about climate change, but other things that are very popular among climate change deniers like abortion and immigration. A portion of American’s were very unhappy with Obama being elected. So when they saw that they shared that unhappiness with climate change deniers, it got them thinking that these climate change deniers were probably saying something worth listening to. This idea that a lack of a consensus means something isn’t true needs to fade. We need to look at the science and the facts to know what’s true, and we have known for over 50 years but people still deny it.

I think that it is very important to understand both sides of an argument before you actually pick one. I think that it would be very ignorant of someone to decide to believe in something without understanding the point of view of those that you are opposing. Unfortunately, this is something that I notice people rarely do, and refuse to even acknowledge the validity, or lack thereof, of the opposition. A quick example that comes to mind to describe what I mean is partisan politics, particularly in this day and age where people will refuse to even be in the same room with somebody on the opposing party, and will refuse much more to hear their points. 
     <br><Br>

Looking at this reading as a whole, it sort of scared me as it made some valid points that are actually credible as the reading is filled with their references. I wasn’t scared because it made my views conflict. I’ve read hundreds of papers and articles on climate change, and one (this one) against it. The reason that this scared me is that I’m concerned with how many people this actually convinced that climate change isn’t an issue. Like Ken said, there can be up to 10 million children in school which can be taught this because their teachers may have been convinced against climate change, 
     <br><Br>

I really like that this reading was a part of this course. I think it is crucial to understand both sides, and while my opinion wasn’t changed, it is important to have as much information as possible to be able to understand the issue completely and form a valid argument for whatever side you are on.

When reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", I was left feeling very confused because there were a lot of facts and statistics that were given regarding climate change, but many of them were proven not to be reliable because of bias in their statistics and the non-credibility of their sources. The main claim of this book is that  "there is no survey or study showing "consensus" on the most important scientific issues in the climate change debate" (pg. 7). This is proven throughout the rest of the reading and is what leads to a majority of my confusion because at the beginning they state that there is no consensus about the major issues regarding climate change but than there are many accounts that are introduced where writers state statistics that they believe to be 100% accurate, and we as readers believe them because the writers don’t give us reason not to or they do but we are not aware. I was convinced by this reading because they only gave examples of articles regarding climate change that can in no way be accurate. This is exactly what the authors are doing in this book because it makes the reader want to trust the writer and not the people who they are writing about.  We tend to believe these statistics because when reading, we tend not to do research on the people who are writing the article or the companies that publish the article, which as I have learned from the article, can lead to very biased results. This article shows that some people who publish articles on climate change have no expertise in that area or are demonstrating biased opinions because they are being paid by fossil fuel companies. It also shows that people are using non credible sources and ignoring sources that would seem to contradict there argument.
     <br><Br>

I find all of this to be very frustrating because climate change is not an issue that you want to be lied to about because teaching others that climate change is not an issue can lead to drastic results. In Ken’s video “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, Ken states that “[The Heartland Institute] mailed 300,000 unsolicited and free copies of the book… to K-12 teachers across the U.S in 2017”. It is scary that The Heartland Institute's motives in doing this is to target children and teach them through the teachers they have given there books to, that climate change is not a definite issue. It is very difficult to understand why The Heartland Institute would want to do this because by teaching children this notion of climate change, they are teaching them how to continue to destroy their own planet.

<p>
These chapters from "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" were very hard for me to read for so many reasons.
     <br><Br>

First of all, I know of institutions like the Heartland Institute, CARE, etc., like Ken says, they are all fossil fuel backed organizations. Many produce literature that inspires doubt about all kinds of things. Things that, if regulated, would decrease their profits.This doubt is then reflected in public opinion, people are now confused. Public opinion is divided, and then policy makers cannot act to create policy. This is their goal, to delay policy that will result in the loss of profit. Second of all, in the very beginning with that message from Marita Noon, she links the climate crisis to former president Barrack Obama; I bring this up because Obama was political leader that faced such intense amounts of scrutiny in the eyes of people with conservative views that even mentioning his name is bound to convince some that the climate crisis is a hoax. I feel like pasting Obama as the front man for the so called hoax is infuriating. Why am I infuriated? Maybe because he was not even as big of an advocate as Al Gore, but when he served as president he was a focal point for placing blame, which I think is largely to do with his race. That being said, they're really just using peoples beliefs about Obama to influence the targeted audience into thinking that the climate crisis is fake.
     <br><Br>
Anyways, the idea that they gave these books– which are written not to sound alarmist, meant to sound reasonable and technical– to teachers in order to incite doubt from teacher to student is... hmmm... heinous and in character.

<p>

This reading was the most frustrating yet. To me, it honestly isn’t relevant that scientists aren’t agreeing totally with each other regarding the climate crisis. Disagreeing is part of the process of science; it is how one generates new questions to investigate and forms hypothesis’. Yet this reading is simply an accumulation of precise instances of disagreement and reasoning for them… Which, in every case, I still feel could be interpreted in many ways. It is utterly flabbergasting to be given “factual” statements that are sourced from a place that, in my opinion, is rooted in evil. I am reminded of flavored nicotine vaporizers marketed to children, and before that big tobacco; or of the violently polar Trump campaign, and even before that, the political atmosphere I imagine Hitler produced. There are irrefutable pieces of evidence that show the way that our planet is changing, often related more to our rate of consumption rather than warming and greenhouse gases, yet the argument remains particular and narrow. The concept that every person crafts their own reality is overwhelmingly present in my mind as I read these three chapters; it is a cruel truth that people will only believe what they want, and deniers manifest this doubt and aim to spread it like a virus. 
      <br><Br>

I find it heartbreaking to hear that this corrupt and economically focused argument is being spoon-fed to the youth of our country in their classroom. While it is not something we experience in California, it’s scary to consider the opponents we might face as we all gain political awareness and power. It also makes me consider, however, the level of indoctrination that we personally are facing when defending the climate crisis. We are being given equally alarmist content in this very class; it is just less controversial because it aligns with the majority of our opinions. How much of this crisis really is a matter of “he said, she said”? I have conversed with some professors here about climate change, some in the biology department, one in global studies, and one in geology. All had very!! different opinions and explanations for different topics, some strongly disagreeing with the mainstream global warming, sea level rise, climate change debates. Disheartening, yet clarifies the political toxicity of the topic and the reasoning for economic preferences taking dominance over possible yet controversial threats to our global safety.

I share your frustration having read, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming.” I agree that the debate around climate change is a natural part of the expression of ideas and opinions and that dispute is inevitable. I had similar realizations regarding how people self-servingly and ignorantly craft their own reality in order to distort the real matter at hand. I find it deeply concerning as well knowing that the classroom content and curriculum presented to our younger generations will have an impact on their perception of these worldly issues. 
      <br><Br>
I find your observation quite insightful regarding the content in our class and how it seems to be less controversial because of the political climate in California and and the opinions of those in the majority of our generation.
      <br><Br>
I think it is important to keep in mind that this controversy has grown to be politically toxic and tends to turn politically corrupt in debate. Our global safety is without a doubt being threatened by this corruption and manipulation.

When I first started reading this I didn’t actually realize that it was a product of a conservative think tank, which actually made the experience of reading the first part of it kinda interesting to reflect on (though in retrospect I should have noticed sooner) One of the first claims of the book is that the climate change movement has been used by politicians to gain poltical power, and I thought “Well good causes are hijacked all the time by people with bad intentions” and kept reading. Then it carefully steered into the conversation of how the scientific community actually disagrees on many things and so the 97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing climate change is an “oversimplification” which again made sense, though at this point I had missed several more warning bells.
      <br><Br>

When I started to realize something was up was when I got to the “key findings” section right before the introduction. It claimed that there has been a “stable temperature” since 1997, which raised my eyebrow. I clearly remembered at least the last two years at least were the hottest on record, so I checked the publishing date, 2016. I thought “ok, maybe they are already just really outdated,” but then I soon ran into the last “fact” that the “Melting of Arctic sea ice and polar icecaps is not occurring at ‘unnatural’ rates.” This made me realized something was pretty wrong. Before the Flood clearly showed how fast the ice caps were melting, and it couldn’t have not been melting fast enough to notice in 2016. This is what promoted me to then watch to watch Ken’s follow up video on the book, which then sure enough turned out to be strait out of a conservative think tank.
      <br><Br>

The fact that I have been learning about the climate crisis from English 22 and 23, and this was able to make me think twice about the whole thing for a second, that is really scary. The fact that this book is being sent to teachers and policy makers is despicable. I now understand a bit more the real power  behind the oil lobby, not necessarily them bribing our politicians with campaign money, but disseminating their lies into millions of schoolchildren through their teachers. This is what we are up against. And I have no idea how it is possible for us to beat that.

I completely agree with you. When I first started to read this article before the lecture on Friday, I was confused about why we were reading something that was so utterly conservative in their perspective. Many of the factual pieces of scientific evidence initially confused me in regards to the actual factuality of this book and its sources. Just like you mentioned the "stable temperature" point made no sense to me and at first, I thought it was just a fluke, but after reading through more of the article it was clear what point of view was being told. When I got to the part in the article that discussed how the climate crisis was harming the advancement of technology proved to me that this was written with the success of businesses in mind. 

      <br><Br>

I think its absolutely absurd that articles like these are published and seen as "scientific" records and it's so much more clear to me how so many people have gotten mislead about the actual severity of the climate crisis. Like Ken mentioned in the lecture, this book was sent to many political leaders which explains why our government is convinced that the climate crisis isn't real or urgent. I truly hope that everyone who gets their hands on this book can notice the rhetoric and realize that it's simply out of a conservative think tank because it's scary to think books and articles like this, are able to turn so many people away from the real-life evidence of the tremendous increases in fires and storms, and there is certainly not a stable temperature.

When I was reading "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming", I too found myself being tricked by their carefully crafted arguments and found myself confused on the real truth behind the Climate Crisis. A big part of the argument being presented is the authors asserting that we can't follow the 97% of scientists that agree that anthropogenic climate change is real simply because many of those scientists aren't specialists in climate change. While this could be a valid point, I think its naive to completely disregard anything that those scientists have to say. The authors claim that climate change is a very interdisciplinary field, so the idea that any one group has the answers is clearly telling lies. Not only does this completely discredit their own argument, but it encourages the idea that we must know everything in order to make a conclusion. Science itself is built on the ideas of formulating hypothesis' and making efforts to solve those questions/problems, so to argue that no one knows enough so the idea isn't real is a very backwards way of going about things. At the end of the day, this issue should be a partisan one, or even a scientific one, it needs to be a human one. No matter what, the world needs to work together to solve this problem by any means necessary or else there wont be anything left to argue over. 
      <br><Br>
Another argument that is presented is the idea of "publication bias", where studies will only point out the significant parts of their data that will strengthen their case. Ironically, this book is a giant example of publication bias, with much of its funding and development being backed by huge oil/fossil fuel companies, who will do anything in their power to make money. 
      <br><Br>
One last thing I found quite sinister yet incredibly effective was the decision to make this book freely available on the internet in addition to mailing copies to educators around the country. To any normal teacher, such a book will seem incredibly credible with all of its references to studies and carefully constructed arguments. Then, as this teacher decides to try and share this information with her students, the real problem arises. Although it may not be definite, planting the ideas of misinformation in impressionable students' minds will have lasting effects on the global consensus of climate change.

After reading the first three chapters of the book  “why scientists disagree on global warming” I was surprised to learn about several things that if true undermine the current climate change consensus. For example, the possibility that climate alarmists and activists could be using information that is not credible is a big issue for understanding the truth of this complex issue. In addition, the possibility that natural causes could be fueling the the rise in CO2 seems far fetched but is not completely off the table for me. I think the article has a good point in that, “Disagreement is the rule and consensus is the exception in most academic disciplines.”
      <br><Br>
However, despite all the interesting counterpoints to the climate change argument, the simple origins of the book discredit its interesting claims. The fact that it was promoted to teachers by fossil fuel money makes it extremely biased. Because of this, the book comes off as manipulative and not credible.

When opening the link to the PDF “Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming” I was excited to see what they had to say about it, I didn’t think it would be on climate change denial but on the different theories scientists have as to why the climate crisis is happening. Once I read the foreword, I instantly realized that this was coming from a conservative initiative:
      <br><Br>


“President Barack Obama and his followers have repeatedly declared that climate change is “the greatest threat facing mankind.” This, while ISIS is beheading innocent people, displacing millions from their homeland, and engaging in global acts of mass murder.”
      <br><Br>


I couldn’t help but to think this was a bit of a reach being that things like war crimes (committed mainly by Americans), extreme gang violence, and corrupt governments existing are also huge concerns of any administration, and that just because climate change isn’t visibly threatening us does not mean it is not a pressing issue. I just had to point out that was a weird comparison but anyway, it clarified to me that this “research” was politically charged even though the arguments against climate research mentioned in the PDF itself were that the IPCC etc. had a political agenda. Regardless, I gave it a shot and read (most of) it. I found myself willing to question what I had been told my entire life, but with a grain of salt being that the arguments presented were funded by the Heartland Institute, which is literally affiliated directly with the fossil-fuel industry. So, once I put that all together I was pissed, and still am. 
      <br><Br>
Climate change is such an important issue, and the thought that companies are willing to sway public opinion for 60 more years of solid business (or until the Earth is uninhabitable, which is really soon) just so they can have their billionaire status moment is insufferable. I cannot believe that we have gotten to a point where monetary gain, a concept that we give value to to be able to exchange for goods, for no reason has more power over the human species existing. Like, it’s not even a real thing (like it is but it isn’t you know what I’m trying to say)! The fact that we allow these companies to fund biased-research just for the sake of those companies to be able to wave their documents around like “Hey! We have our own research and you might be wrong! So, since there are two sides to it because apparently it’s just a matter of how you research it fire up the carbon emissions!” is nauseating. 
      <br><Br>
Climate change is not a partisan issue, or an opinion. There is so much evidence from so many different parties all saying that anthropogenic climate change is a fact, and is happening, and getting worse by the day. It hurts to know that nearly 300,000 children could be brought up to question these changes on our planet just because some company doesn’t want to change the ways they produce things because it’s “too expensive” (even though they make more money than any of us could ever dream of having). What about their children? Do they really want to create a world where their child or grandchild may live in a bunker for the rest of their life and never be able experience the world?

Yes, climate change isn't an opinion or a partisan issue; it's a phenomenon. I don't think anyone denies that. How to act on climate change is itself the partisan issue here. The children of billionaires will be fine whether or not climate change happens. Wealth in this country is extremely deterministic and I doubt that the billionaire children will be significantly impeded by climate change. As to your last question: perhaps. "Experiencing the world" is ultimately subjective so it is a little dramatic to claim that their children will live in "bunkers" and will suffer tremendously. Humans have evolved to make sure we spread our genes to the next generation; as such it is not a surprise to me that some would continue their "destructive" acts in order to provide a comfortable life for their children -- perhaps at the indirect cost of many others.

I think in the reading, the author's arguments kinds of make sense to me. I understand those examples he mentioned in the article, like those bias polling and non-professional authors. However, I still feel weird why there is an article telling us there is no such thing as climate change, and it was not caused by human pollution. After watching the lecture video, I understand why. If those authors who deny climate change are funded by the fossil fuel industry, then every word in their articles may not be true. I highly doubt if the reading is talking about truth, or the author wrote it simply because of money. No matter what, I still believe there is a climate crisis, and human must have some correlation with it.

It was interesting to hear the other side of the argument as this whole time we have been looking only at what proves our hypothesis. I think it is logical to look into how the null hypothesis is ruled out. This book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" has a lot of points that are a bit hypocritical and lack evidentiary support and therefore did not convince me to switch my stance on climate change. I found it interesting how the authors attacked the IPCC. They claim that these scientists are not all masters of climate scientists, but rather masters in their specific fields like physics making them inadequate in helping contribute to the issue. This to me was not a good enough argument because scientists from different areas can help the committee form a well-rounded hypothesis which has been done. It would be ridiculous to only employ climate scientists in the issue if biologists, geologists, and more can weigh in on it. I also found it extremely hypocritical of the Heartland Institute to claim that scientists are biased. They argue that scientists are paid by government agencies, interest groups which causes them to lean towards the side of anthropogenic climate change. However, the same can be said about the authors of this book .They very well, as Ken says, are Conservative Think Tanks (CTT) that are funded by the fossil fuel industry. Another argument of theirs that I did not agree on was their claim that the scientific method is not being employed by the IPCC, but rather political science. As a political science major, we have learned that political science is indeed a binary to the scientific method. Political scientists do not go out and find evidence supporting their hypothesis, but rather gather all evidence before rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis. If they had said that the IPCC is not following the scientific method but rather social justice I would've listened to their argument. I think they do not fully know what political science is and misinterpreted political science for social justice, which actually does not gather all evidence before drawing a conclusion. Yes, political science is a social science and not a natural science, however, that does not entail that political science does not use the scientific method. I found this entire part invalid as the authors do not even know the meaning of political science. In conclusion, I find it awful how this book was sent to teachers, who then pass on their knowledge to kids who take in whatever teachers dispel. It is quite alarming that this has happened and there is no way to reverse this damage. All we can do is to continue to disseminate the knowledge of anthropogenic climate change as Ken has done for us to try to counteract the propaganda of the CTT.

I really agree that the arguments in the book “Why scientists disagree about global warming”sound quite weak. Also, a lot of statements that make a rebuttal against the climate change theory are not supported by evidence but rather stand a lone. For example in the sentence “the U.S. government alone paid $64 billion to climate researchers...virtually all of it explicitly assuming or intended to find a human impact on climate and virtually nothing on the possibility of natural causes of climate change”, the author suggests that the government “assume”and “intend”to find human effects on climate change instead of natural factors. This, to me is a ridiculous guess, pretending that he knows all about what the government has been thinking. There are many more examples like this, making random claims without verifying them. 
      <br><Br>


I also realized that the author of this book is very good at manipulating readers’ thought and influencing them unconsciously by using words like “allegedly”, “perceived consensus”to hint that the climate scientists’ consensus does not exist at all. Tiny details like this might add persuasiveness into the language and makes their claim seem more credible. What’s more, I think that the claim saying that "very few scholars have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines” is nonsense as well. The last half of the statement might be true to some extent, but scientists across different disciplines have come together, collaborate, and share study results and discuss. Interdisciplinary studies have been undertaken for decades and the climate change deniers are even still holding on to opinions like this, saying that few are professional in multiple science areas of study so that climate science is not trustworthy at all. 
      <br><Br>


In general, reading all the oppositions against climate change theory in this book makes me lean more on the latter side instead because the whole book sounds very unconfident. Rather than debunking the scientific theories using professional knowledge, the author spends a whole lot more time denying the existence of the consensus and the organizations’(mainly IPCC’s) political identity and composition. Meanwhile, every other argument can be used by climate scientists to refute the deniers, including production bias, research methodologies, careerism, and etc.

To be honest, I felt the same confusion after reading the chapters assigned in “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change”. Although I had heard of different perspectives on climate change prior to reading this book, i was bombarded with the amount of statistical information and convincing arguments that it gave in denying the existence of climate change. For example, one of the most important and repeated quote in the book was that climate change is represented by the quote, "97% of all scientists agree on human caused climate change". To disclaim this quote, the book mentioned all sorts of publication bias, volunteer bias, and sampling bias that affects the collecting of the data behind the quote. In the end, it even said that this 97% actually only consisted of 79 scientists. When I read this, I was dumbfounded. 
      <br><Br>
But just like you mentioned, it is true that this book was published by big fossil fuel companies in order for them to continue profiting. Not only Heartland Institute, but so many other companies, under the guise of technological and human advancement continue to pollute and damage the environment without the public's knowledge. 
      <br><Br>
Recently, I watched a video talking about how Chase bank was as responsible for climate change as Exxon, Chevron, and all the other big fossil fuel companies. Because Chase supports the fossil fuel companies by investing money in more operations that ruin the environment. However, I believe, that just like me, many people are unaware of this investment and unaware of Chase's big role behind the scenes. This is just one of the examples where there is too much crowded information and disinformation, but also at the same time, not enough information about climate change for the people to properly understand and learn.

To be honest, I am completely surprised by the title of the book which is Why Scientists Disagree with Global Warming. However, this is the first time I hear that there are some disagreement to the global warming. In my opinion, most of the scientists will stand at the same side which is agree that there is global warming, and I also hold the same standpoint. The reason behind it is that many phenomenons show us strongly that global temperature is constantly rising, for instance, melting ice in north and south poles, rising sea level. These are facts that happen in our life every day. And not only in class, bust also from various social media, I also realize that people are still cutting trees and burning fossil fuels. These behaviors are harmful to environment and accelerating the rate of global warming. According to common sense, disagreement is the first impression when I see the title of assigned book.
      <br><Br>

When I am reading this “strange “ book, I find that there are a lot of contradictions about global warming and climate change. Each scientist have a totally different view about this topic, and they have diverse types of interpretations for this serious problem. It is very interesting for me to analyzing each opinion. I notice that some of them are biased and bring up some weird assumptions. I think the reason for it should be they do not have enough data, or even their data are inaccurate. Based on this reason, we should pay attention to the accuracy of data. Correct data could help us to calculate the right result and utilize the result in the future situation. It will be helpful, because we could also know what and to how much extent we need to do to prevent more serious climate change.

“Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is a book that seems plausible, but the institute which published the book is not a reliable organization since it is funded by fossil fuel companies. Also, many free copies of the book are sent to K-12 teachers to obfuscate the real reason that causes climate change, and lots of teachers have believed in the arguments proposed by the book. Furthermore, they will teach the students about the materials and "facts" listed in the book. Moreover, the data in the book is quoted from the articles that public by conservative think tanks. In addition, the book is produced by an Institute, Heartland Institute, which committed a group called Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), which produces many reports to rebut the reports written by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This organization also fought against tobacco regulation, because it got huge funding from a tobacco company.

   After reading the first 3 chapters, I was confused about what I have learned about climate change. I was thinking whether the climate is changing and whether climate change is caused by humans. Since the arguments are misleading and tricky, I believe that many people will be confused about the climate crisis. Also, the Heartland Institute publishes this book not only targets the public, but it also targets children who will believe it immediately without any doubt. I was shocked by the malicious intent, and I feel hopeless after I know that many states that mandate their students to be taught that the scientific consensus on climate change is wrong. In my perspective, if there is a way to mitigate climate change, the young generation will play an important role in solving the crisis. However, they are not taught to reduce CO2 emission but to be indifferent to climate change.

I agree with your statement of this institute not being reliable due to them being paid out by fossil fuel companies, however, many people would not know this without extra research into this institute. That is the real problem with this book, unless the readers of this book are well educated or dig into the history of the authors of this book, they could easily believe in their statements. You even stated yourself that it caused you to feel conflicted about what was the truth, the lectures we have received from Ken or this book. The troubles with this book being sent to K-12 teachers is that they would not have the extra time to fact check this book or even think of fact-checking the book. I for one have never fact-checked a book or an article in my life because when we see that something has been published and shared widely, we assume that it would have already been fact-checked and approved by the time that we started reading. In addition, Ken brought up the point that certain states are even “attempting to go even further in mandating that students be taught that the scientific consensus on climate change is simply wrong” which in theory helps this book’s success in those states due to the teachings already following the same path that this book takes.

In my personal opinion, I did not find this book to be very compelling to disprove climate change due to the fact that they displayed their references after almost every subheader. I understand that they are quoting many different references throughout their work but it feels as though this is just a way to make them seem more credible. In reality, they are taking quotes and numbers out of context to help prove their own point even though the context of those quotes may have been proving a different thing. I could say that Ken does not believe in climate change being caused by humans because in this very video he stated “the greenhouse gas CO2 is not, in fact, a contributing factor to climate change.” That is the scary part of this all, they are taking facts and rephrasing them so that it can help prove their point in saying that climate change is not an issue we should be worrying about. Additionally, they add topics such as getting clean water and electricity to the millions of people in poverty and this can easily pull on the heartstrings of the readers because most people don’t really want others to be suffering. The problem with them going off course toward other problems is that if we do not fix climate change we won’t have to fix those other problems because we ultimately will all be dead due to the conditions created by climate change.

While I was reading this article, I felt that this is one of the worst articles that I have read. In the book, it is mainly saying that the authors of those statements are not credible, and there are arguments between professors and scientists from different perspectives. However, the author of this book doesn’t have the main statement except he repeatedly argued that don’t believe in others’ statements that climate change is caused by human actions. Furthermore, there is no explanation of that is the case. The author just kept saying others’ statements are uniliteral and narrow. Thus, I couldn’t even believe it.
        <br><Br>

Before reading watching this week’s homework, I knew that the Fossil Fuel Industry is trying to make people believe that climate change is not as bad as it was said on the news and it is not merely caused by a human being, but I have never imagined that they would print books to target the next generation. This is unforgivable. The fossil fuel industry should be blamed for teaching the next generation the wrong things. In the film “Fire in Paradise”, the PG&E didn’t cut off the power lines and caused the fire that killed many people. If the fossil fuel industry keeps teaching children that climate change isn’t real, in the future there will be more disasters like the fire that will kill more people. 
        <br><Br>

I agree with professor Ken’s opinion that education is crucial in climate crises, actually not only climate crisis, but every aspect. How can children do the right things without knowing the truth? Then, how can our civilization grow?

In reading the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” I had a few separate reactions. I found it interesting how compelling the argument that this book made was, despite my knowing that its writing was likely biased. Although I could see how the arguments that the book made could appeal to a certain audience I found a lot of their arguments and talking points baseless and slightly hypocritical. For example their argument that climate scientists, like all humans, can be biased doesn't make a much sense as using that logic, their writing is also biased because they are humans as well. Also their arguments about how certain studies and claims made by “alarmists' ' seemed a little nit-picky because a lot can be contested in a statistical evaluation because of how many different components and variables there are in reality. Because of this, it is not that hard to pick and choose certain rules that help insulate a statistical survey from certain variables and construe these rules as biased. However, despite some of these faulty arguments the book does make some good points that could lead someone to question climate change and whether it really is a result of human activity. For example some of the reasons that the book gave for why institutions like the IPCC and their research could be biased such as careerism and the need for funding do make sense. I think that the overarching argument of the book was presented in a way that was to target less knowledgeable people on climate change and thus not talk about the science of what is going on but instead make reasonable easy to understand arguments that readers can understand. Overall I can see how the book would be effective in showcasing its point of view but it struck me as biased because of multiple flawed arguments and the fact that the writers seemed pre-decided in shunning climate scientists as “alarmists” and discounting the IPCC straight out of the gate.

I find this book very interesting because a lot of the points that were brought up had never crossed my mind before. I feel like that’s kind of the point with all of the articles and videos we watch, which is to maybe be surprised or shocked at the new information being presented at us. One of the biggest claims in these chapters was that even if the climate crisis is real, there is no evidence that stands out showing that this was not created by humans, and that it’s nature causing this crisis. But, even if that was the case, that none of the carbon dioxide from the greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels were having any effect on our planet’s environment and it’s caused by nature, shouldn’t we still realize that this is an issue and we should still act fast to save the earth? They also brought up that the “corruption of science” is kind of like the corruption of the fossil fuel industry and that some people benefit from convincing other people that the climate crisis is real. I find that extremely hard to believe, or even if that were true, why would scientists want to fabricate a lie and tell the public that we are all in danger of a mass extinction soon? Along with this idea, the book stated, “Climate scientists, like all humans, can be biased. Origins of bias include careerism, grant-seeking, political views, and confirmation bias”(31). These scientists from the book believe that everything found supporting the climate crisis is just circumstantial evidence, and not observational evidence, being altered and blaming global warming. I still don’t think that that is the case. 
        <br><Br>

I understand where Professor Hiltner is coming from when he says that teachers normally teach that this is a two sided argument and we should be aware of what each side has to say about this important issue. I agree with him that education is very important and especially teaching about the climate crisis since there are so many individuals who may not be fully aware of what is going on and are now starting to become more involved and more educated on this topic. He also mentions in his video that most times, “A book denying climate change was most likely published or financed by a conservative think tank, funded by the fossil fuel industry.” So when this book is arguing that the scientists who believe that the climate crisis is real just because they are corrupt and benefiting from it, we must think to ourselves, “but how much more is the fossil fuel industry benefiting from destroying the planet?”.

With the distribution of Heartland Institute's "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" to K-12 teachers, these teachers are then given the power to teach kids the incorrect and inaccurate information that denies climate change. I believe that when you're young, you're much easier to sway into a view. With the influence of teachers, the people who teach and educate our kids,  of course the kids are going to believe their teacher, after all, that's their job. If we don't realize what is at stake here, our world will be ultimately doomed. We need to put accurate facts into the hands of the children.

It truly is frightening to realize how damning it can be for kids to be taught false information about the world, especially something as important as climate change. Childhood and early education, prior to becoming an adult capable of affecting public policy through voting or other means, sets the foundation for lifelong learning and developing one's world view. I am grateful to my environmental science teacher in high school who taught me about climate change, but it is discouraging to know that a lot of teachers aren't trained or willing to expose their students to climate change literature.

        <br><Br>

To think that the Heartland Institute and other CTTs are attempting to influence future generations for financial and political gain is really disappointing. Young students should receive an education that properly equips them with the knowledge to be a well-informed citizen that is capable of making decisions that better society, not harm it.

I believe this is yet again another example of the huge role our government plays in our climate crisis. Many of the large problems we are facing are being fueled and worsened by wealthy government officials who have large investments in the fossil fuel industry. It is very sad to observe that many of our lawmakers are more invested in making money than passing valuable legislation. It is even sadder to me that these fossil fuel corporations and conservative think tanks are so focused on securing profits that they are sending false information to teachers all over the country as an attempt to brainwash the minds of young children. 
        <br><Br>
In order to combat this issue as well as spread more awareness, I do believe the issue of our climate crisis should be more widespread in schools. While in high school, I was educated about the growing concerns of anthropogenic climate change in my AP Environmental Science class. However, many of my classmates not enrolled in that class were not exposed to the same material. I believe awareness of our climate crisis should be integrated into school curriculum at an early age and continued to be talked about throughout high school. Educating people is one of the best ways we can spread awareness of the issue. If kids are surrounded by this issue at school, they are going to bring it home to their parents and it will continue to spread. With more concrete awareness, hopefully our society can begin to make small changes that will help preserve our earth.

Before reading this book, Ken told us not to be surprised if we were a little persuaded. I didn't think so at the beginning. After so many classes, searching so many materials and watching so many movies, I think I have fully agreed that the existence of climate problems is caused by human beings. It wasn't until I read the book that I understood where Ken's reminders came from. The author uses a lot of scientific methods to persuade readers that the climate crisis is a natural phenomenon. Although the author's method of argument is to emphasize the loopholes of other scientists' research, it does not hinder the persuasion of this book. I'm very glad that before I read this article, I met Ken, not a teacher who was influenced by fossil fuel industries and may deliver the wrong information.

        <br><Br>

I read some students' comments, they think this article is unreasonable. Actually not. If you give it to your parents or a friend who has never been exposed to the knowledge of environmental problems, they may become those who do not believe that environmental issues are caused by human beings. We read the article with bias, and obviously, we don't care about every word in it. But for those who have reached this kind of idea for the first time, every argument of the author is very persuasive. No wonder on Amazon, the review of this book will be polarized. It is reasonable to understand that some people may give one star and the other may give five stars.

Reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” was difficult. I had to laugh at some of the claims they made, but as an Environmental Studies major, I’m probably “biased and driven by careerism, grant-seeking”, or whatever, right? What a load of bull. Some of the claims that were especially audacious led me to look at their source, like the claim that the scientific journal Nature was in support of disbanding the IPCC. Surprise, surprise: the Nature statement IS in support of the IPCC, and just thinks the research could now be more specific to further political action and provide faster answers than a years-long assessment. I’ve read Naomi Oreskes’ paper on scientific consensus as well as Merchants of Doubt, and it was very clear how Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming used the tactics like cherry-picking and exaggerating the uncertainty in science (science literally always has a little uncertainty). So many of the book’s arguments could also be turned right around on them (political motivations? using false experts? relying on non-scientists?). But to the untrained eye, this book definitely might seem legitimate.
        <br><Br>

The authors sending this book to schoolteachers is scary. Unfortunately, the United States doesn’t exactly have very high standards for K-12 teachers, just as we don’t have very high standards for our education (ranking 27th in the world!). This means that there are probably a lot of teachers who were convinced by this. Talk about indoctrinating children. It’s so frustrating because it’s not a debate. Climate change is real, it’s happening now, and it’s already hurting people and all other life on this planet. Unfortunately, the nature of science and the complexity of climate change make it easy to create doubt. This is a problem that is affecting all of our ecosystems and all of our communities, which means there are a lot of places to poke holes into the science and claim that “it’s just too complicated for us to accept.” But it’s also pretty clear that the authors of this book are losing. Most major world governments and the United Nations are agreeing on this issue and funding work to research and solve the problem, and I think it’s going to be nearly impossible to prove that the entire governmental group of people are all part of some mission to deceive the world. The truth will prevail, but will it be fast enough?

I generally like to hear the counterpoints of an argument because they are useful in taking a well-rounded position on whatever the argument may be. However, on the debate on whether global warming is happening it's useless to hear the other side because there is decisive evidence proving the earth is warming in response to our anthropogenic pollution and any evidence saying otherwise is manipulated and deceiving. The arguments laid out in the book "Why Scientists Disagree about global warming" I felt were exactly that manipulated and deceiving. In the book's introduction, they make claims that deniers are being persecuted for speaking freely and that government officials are supporting the movement to gain more power and profit. Additionally, they tried to say that the general public is being told to not look behind the curtain like in the movie "Wizard of Oz." I found these statements humorous because the argument they began with sounded like a conspiracy theory that the government is corrupt and trying to push a secretive agenda. However, to undecided individuals on the topic of global warming, this could be very deceiving because the authors follow these claims with endless pages where they find very small holes in academic papers to try and reinforce the idea that there isn't a strong enough consensus to believe global warming is an issue. Additionally, the book uses individuals with a scientific background to present the points they want to make which is, even more problematic because most people including myself will take what scientists say at face value rather than looking deeper since it's assumed they're specialists in these areas. So when professor Hiltner said that the heartland organization sent 300,000 of these copies to k-12 educators this was very alarming since like professor Hiltner said this could lead to misinforming 10million kids on the climate crisis we live in. This would be detrimental to the fight on climate change since the hope for change rides on the future generations and misinforming them would possibly create another generation of climate deniers which are the same as the ones fighting change now. In the book, they repeated the idea that climate supporters weren't looking at the bigger picture which was why their claims weren't accurate but really these climate deniers aren't looking at the bigger picture of the consequences their denial is having now and will have to come.

The book simply criticizes scientists and their articles and claims that climate change is caused by natural change. I read the book in a doubtful attitude. In academics, it’s normal that two opposite parties’ debate on whether something is true or not. The book does the same thing and exactly finds every possible evidence to prove scientists who support human impacts on natural change are false and unconvincing. The book suggests counting 97% of scientists who agree with humans take responsibility for climate change is abstract. However, just like an example in chapter 1 No Consensus, the book says that half of the articles that Anderegg provides  incorresponding abstracts and experiments data in the content without talking about the left 50% of claims which is convincing. 
        <br><Br>

The book exists bias anyway, which criticizes scientists who support human-made climate change. In fact, the book avoids talking about true and convincing experiments and research that the scientists who agree with human-made climate change have done before. The book says that these scientists who believe human-made climate change lack research and picks evidence that benefit themselves but authors of the book also picks persuasive evidence that good for the book’s arguments. The book is also extreme by considering human will not impact the climate at all. 
        <br><Br>

Also, according to Ken’s video, I then noticed that the NPCC organization is funded by a fossil fuel company. They put in much effort to write the book and spread their opinion to children and society. They are destroying our next generation by desires toward money. The selects useful information for their propaganda and puts it online. They give misleading information to make people confuse or even stand at their side. For some scientists who do not support man-made climate change, they probably choose to search and understand the real cause and sequences of climate change instead of writing a book first and collects negative information to attack other scientists. Since the book has been written several years ago and some K-12 teachers use it as resources, it influences and delays the process of spreading credible information to the society.

Ken’s video provide me better background information of this book, Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming. In chapter 1, the book indicates that there’s no scientific consensus on the most important issues in the debate of climate change, describing many studies that provide evidence of lack of consensus and using the example of Global Warming Petition Project.  It aggressively attack the credibility of the methodology of many surveys that conclude with the consensus of anthropogenic climate crisis. In chapter 2 and chapter 3, the authors criticize the failure of IPCC and bias among scientists. But I want to say that, if other scientists are biased, why scientists in your camp are not biased? Also, the authors’ chicanery that few of them get financial support from fossil fuel industry is pale and unpersuasive.
        <br><Br>

    By introducing themselves as serious and scrupulous scientists who are always calumniated by IPCC and other people with power, the authors of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” transform into the oppressed that strive for the truth of global climate condition. The book fiercely enumerates numbers of scientists who disagree with climate crisis, emphasizing how professional they are and how important their neglected opinions are. Although I totally agree with anthropogenic climate change, I have to admit that this book could possibly confuse and sway many people’s attitudes. If readers blindly follow the seemingly good logic of this book, they may be persuaded to believe in the climate denialism. However, I consider this book ridiculous and meaningless because there are so much evidence showing the catastrophic human-made climate change such as scary wildfire in California everywhere and every year. The authors also avoid talking about the data of how human’s use of fossil fuels influence the environment, while only focus on how to denigrate other scientists. The purpose of this book is apparent and I can’t see any contribution it makes for our planet. Overall, I find this book highly deceptive although it artfully slander scientists who advocate anthropogenic climate crisis by attacking their studies and doubting their reliability.

This article was hard to read because I found myself getting mad because of not only the way it was written, but what is written. For one, the author’s biggest evidence and claim against climate change is that we can’t rely on 97% of the scientists who say it’s real. This was stupid because I was thinking: “hmmm, I wonder how the tables would turn if the science was on THEIR side,” and secondly, why is this the first time in history that all of the sudden, science is not important enough to rely on. Hasn’t everything we’ve ever discovered or relied on been tested through science in order to give us the “okay” about the reality of said circumstance. I can’t help but feel that if 97% of scientist stated that global warming was not real, that the deniers would never ever listen to the other side, yet that’s exactly what they want us to do: listen to their side. Another thing that was frustrating about this read is the facetious remarks with a passive aggressive tone. This author claims that the debate deserves two sides and that we never listen to their side, yet every other paragraph contains a passive-aggressive way of saying people who believe in climate change are naive. I don’t know about you, but most people don’t want to hear your side of the story if you’re being sarcastic and offensive to the other side.
        <br><Br>
Additionally, if there’s one thing we should have all learned from the film “Fire in Paradise,” it’s that yes, the precautionary actions cost MONEY, but the affects of climate change cost even more. The author states that, “The global warming movement is the most extensive and most expensive public relations campaign in the history of the world” (xi). This quote only furthers evidence of what climate activists already believe: climate deniers are only concerned about money. The author then goes on to compare the climate crisis to the Wizard of Oz’s looking behind the curtain tale: “Like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, we are told not to look behind the curtain, lest we discover what a total fraud the global warming movement truly is” (15). I would strongly argue that the politicians and the government embody the Oz behind the curtain much more than any climate activist does. For years, we have been told to not look behind the curtain and now that we have, it is obvious the climate crisis deniers are scooping up anything they can to counteract our discovery. I was not convinced for one second during this read. Nice try.

And while it is unfortunate, as Ken mentions, that teachers dedicate so little time to the climate crisis, I think we have to see the positive side to this: growing up, I-and many others- were never taught on this subject and it was treated as a hushed delusion to believe in or discuss. I think that while it is unfortunate not a lot of time is being spent teaching it, even the fact that it is being brought up (two-sided debate or not), is a victory for us who believe in this crisis!

When I first started reading the book, I hadn’t read the webpage introducing the book, any of the Amazon reviews, or watched Ken’s introduction about it. I found myself confused and almost started believing what I was reading until I took a step back and realized this book was denying climate change. I’m shocked at their convincing skills, and can’t believe they mailed 300,000 unsolicited and free copies of the book to K-12 teachers. It’s insidious. What blows my mind the most is that I have believed in climate change my entire life and grew up learning about it, and even I started getting swayed. I can’t even imagine how easy it must be to convince those who may be on the fence on anthropogenic climate change.
        <br><Br>
Their main points to try to dissuade readers of climate change are that 97% of scientists don’t actually all agree that global warming is anthropogenic, that the scientists involved in that statistic and those who contributed to the IPCC report aren’t qualified to make such an important assumption because they haven’t mastered more than one or two subjects (when climate change is an interdisciplinary subject), and the greatest one, that the IPCC is biased, has an agenda, is funded by the government and is therefore corrupt. I find the last one quite good, not because those things are necessarily wrong (although the corrupt part is pushing it), but because the Heartland Institute is literally a fossil fuel affiliate, they are funded by fossil fuel companies, and therefore, are obviously going to try to convince readers that climate change is a hoax, or at least, is not man-made and consequently is nothing to worry about. The fossil fuel companies don’t want to be questioned, and as a result, they fund numerous institutes, politicians, and companies in hopes of brainwashing the public into dissuading them that burning fossil fuels isn’t bad for the planet.
        <br><Br>
When I was reading the part about the Global Warming Petition Project, I was shocked that so many scientists would sign such a document. However, I then looked more into it and found that this project is a widely used source of misinformation. I learned that the only qualification needed to sign the petition and be considered a scientist was having an undergraduate degree in any area of science, losing all of its possible credibility and legitimacy.
        <br><Br>
I truly wonder if those who wrote this book actually believe all that they are writing, that climate change is a natural cycle, or if they actually do know man made climate change is real but are just trying to convince others that it isn’t because of their fossil fuel company affiliations.

After reading about twenty pages of the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I had such a similar feeling to yours. I kind of was convinced by what the authors say about climate change. Honestly, they provide strong evidences to persuade readers to believe what they are talking. However, people can not only trust what they read. We need to consider the severity of an issue based on what we had seen in the past decade. As a student or resident in California, a lot of them have seen numerous fires in front of their eyes. Therefore, they ought to believe that climate change truthfully had brought some devastated impacts to our planet. Also, I noticed that you said The Heartland Institute is funded by fossil fuel companies so that they should convince readers to believe global warming does not destroy our planet. From my point of view, “self-interest” plays a big role in what people say. Obviously, people always make comments that in favor of their perspective. Everyone might show bias in their comments regarding an issue. People need to distinguish right and wrong according to what they had seen and experienced.


<br><hr>
While reading your comment, I found that I experienced a similar train of thought while reading this article. Even with Ken’s warning and even with almost a lifetime of believing that climate change is a dire, real issue, it was terrifyingly easy to succumb to the points brought up by the Heartland Institute. The magnitude of information that is on the internet is astounding, providing the world with a database for almost any subject one could think of. While this has brought about great positive social and technological advancement, it has also allowed for the mass spread of misinformation as anyone can publish anything. I agree with your point about this book being dangerous for anyone that is on the fence about climate change. It is astounding to know that this written piece has been so widely distributed in spaces of learning, when the signers of the petition, as you relayed, had such minimal credentials (a degree in science) and still claim to be scientists. I found your last point to be particularly intriguing as you pondered whether the authors of this book truly believe that climate change is not real and/or is not anthropogenic or if they just claim this fact for the sake of their own personal agenda. We can never know for certain; however, it’s an extremely interesting topic to consider. I feel that there is a chance they do know it’s real, but feel that it is intangible in the scheme of their lifetime (won’t materialize before they die) or they have somehow convinced themselves after years of preaching what they consider to be the fallacy of climate change while they receive profit from the fossil fuel industry.

This reading was very alarming to me, because I was able to see how this book could easily sway the minds of those who are undecided on climate change. The Heartland Institute published this book to convince the general public that scientists do not agree about climate change, and therefore humans and the government should stop their attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One of the biggest qualms that the authors of this book had is the idea that “97% of scientists” agree that anthropogenic climate change is happening. They argue that the way this study was conducted was inaccurate, and that the survey was short, only included a specific subset of scientists, and excluded some data. I can see how this argument would be persuasive to folks on the fence about climate change. 
        <br><Br>

Something else that concerned me about this book was that the Heartland Institute mailed out free, unsolicited copies of this to K-12 teachers in the United States, with the hopes that it would influence them and subsequently teach their students that climate change is not a problem. This angers me because it is such a strategic move that endangers humanity’s future. Without the youth’s support, there is little to no hope that climate change will slow or improve. 
        <br><Br>

Another gripe I had about this book was that one of their main arguments was that no scientist has mastery of more than two sciences. They view this as a problem because climate science is interdisciplinary by nature, and they feel that scientists are not able to see the bigger picture with their limited perspectives. By this logic, how can we trust these deniers to make the decision that climate change is NOT a problem? Do they have mastery in all subjects? No.

I agree with you:  the fact that the Heartland Institute mailed their book to hundreds of thousands of teachers across the U.S. is disturbing. This was a deliberate and well thought out attack on the Earth. It is beyond selfish for these companies to think of their money as more important than the future of children across the nation. Teachers have the opportunity to instill children with passion about the environment and make them feel like they can do something to save it. In highschool I had a teacher like this. Even though she was a chemistry teacher, we were constantly discussing, watching, and reading climate change material in her class. This was the first time I actually realized how serious the climate crisis was. It made me want to take action and spread awareness. I wish I would have had teachers like this earlier on in my life, so I could have recognized the problem faster. It saddens me that the release of those books may be the reason why some kids never learn to care about climate change.

While reading the book myself, I noticed the author spends a lot of time attacking surveys and studies that point towards climate change being real and anthropogenic. While criticizing the Zimmerman and Doran study, the author pointed out that very few of the scientists that participated were of a climate specialty. This is a flawed argument, because in order to get a well-rounded idea, it is important to see how knowledge varies from every field. I also found it interesting that the book put a lot of effort into debunking climate change studies, yet presented no studies with contradicting evidence.

I completely understand where you are coming from, I somewhat had the same reaction you had, in which I found the reading overall alarming to say the least. The fact that these children were being taught that climate change was not a problem really upset me, because it's something many kids often believe when they are being taught by an authority figure. I remember when I was in elementary school, I believe it was the third grade in which the concept of global warming was introduced in one of our lessons, our teacher spent perhaps a small portion of the class going over what it was and from then on we never came back around to it. I think that it's a concept many children in elementary school should learn about at an early age and not be given any incorrect facts about climate change or be told it's not a problem, when clearly it is something larger than a problem.

The thing I noticed most in this article was that it was extremely hypocritical. All of the reading basically accused scientists and the IPPC of being corrupt and biased; However, their choice of words and diction made their argument evidently much more biased than factual. Diction such as "de-legitimize", "corrupt", "ignorant", and "flawed". This book is loaded with words with terrible connotations and seems very opinionated. It angers and confuses me how people, and especially teachers do not see this obviously biased trend throughout the text. I am not trying to blame the teachers but this book gives off many signs of not being legitimate. In order to teach something to a whole new generation of children, approximately 10 million, they should make sure the facts are correct and looking up an actual scientific article is not that difficult of a task. 
        <br><Br>
Another point I would like to discuss is how they undermine some of the most recognized scientists and facilities in the world. They blame most scientists for not being educated enough to research this topic and undermine their education stating that most of them do not even have Ph.D.'s. Even claiming that all the evidence regarding the anthropogenic climate crisis thus far has been run by political interference and a corrupt government that wants to collapse the economy.  Furthermore, directly stating that NASA and other famous science websites are using postulates and confirmation bias. How do people not question the legitimacy of the book?

Truth be told, I could not even read past the first chapter and a half of the novel before having to set my laptop down beside me, take a large gulp of water, and open my laptop back up in disgust to read the rest of it. If you couldn’t already tell, I completely disagree with every aspect of its standpoint. Despite its persuasive qualities and staggering amount of sources cited, I could not buy into any of the erroneous arguments that the book presented. All I could think to myself was, “How could anyone with any level of formal education dismiss the certainty of climate change?”

        <br><Br>

What makes matters worse is, the organization that published the book unsolicitedly sent hundreds of thousands of copies of the novel to institutions for teachers to teach to their students. At such a young age, it is fairly simple to instill any notions and conceptions of the world. As the children grow older, they will continue to maintain this mindset towards anthropogenic damage to our ecosystem and may even continue to teach others these falsified views. It is without a doubt that climate change is occurring before our very eyes and will continue to become a more consequential issue as we allow publications such as thus to further manipulate public opinion.

I honestly had a few good laughs while reading these chapters because of how ludicrous some of the statements sound. This article is attacking the fact that many people who are talking about the issue of climate change are not educated or are not professionals in the field, and because of this their activism is being undermined. However, we know that not everyone has the time or ability to become professionals and dedicate their entire lives to studying this topic. That is why we have scientists, that is why there are people who are dedicating their lives to researching and unmasking the factors behind climate change and the climate crisis. Not only are these scientists working endlessly to teach us how we can act to save our planet, but it angers me that common people who are not well informed often do not take their work seriously,  and this will result in even more negative consequences sooner or later. 
        <br><Br>
I don’t even know how to explain my confusion when reading this book. One section that caught my attention was the two questions asked in a survey, they asked “Q1. When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant? Q2. Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?”. These questions are deemed ‘irrelevant’ to the debate about climate change. I mean ??? How are they not relevant when they are pointing at CLIMATE CHANGE factors, literally the biggest factors that constitute climate change. If anything, these are the most relevant questions when it comes to talking about climate change.  This book goes on to say “the Bray and von Storch surveys also show disagreement and outright skepticism about the underlying science of climate change don’t prevent most scientists from expressing their opinion that man-made global warming is occurring and is a serious problem”. I’m sorry what?? This is not an opinion, it is a FACT that is being ignored and looked at as something you are entitled to have but others can ignore. Global warming should not be considered an opinion, it must be considered a powerful force  that we humans are feeding at our own expense.  

        <br><Br>

Ken's video reiterates the fact that scientist's are not the people who disagree about global warming, it is actually fossil fuel run corporations and their affiliates. What I found more astonishing it that the same young children who will end up suffering the consequences of the current climate crisis are the same ones who are being targeted and taught climate change skepticism. As Ken points out, around 10 million American children are being taught climate denial, and this would not be the case if fossil fuel industries did not feel some sort of threat from climate alarmists, proving that global warming is real and that it is consuming us.

From a young age, we’ve always been taught to view issues from all perspectives before taking a stance. It’s a logical system of approaching problems—especially when it comes to controversial ones—because it allows us to fully consider all aspects when aligning ourselves with a specific viewpoint. While I wholeheartedly support this kind of skepticism when learning, I disagree with the distribution of Heartland Institute’s “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” to K-12 teachers around the United States. The book aims to provide teachers and students an opportunity to debate the reality of anthropogenic climate change and whether or not there really is a consensus among scientists concerning the issue. But there’s an extensive problem with this: Climate change is real, and it's happening now.

        <br><Br>

The arguments that the authors of the book make are convincing, even to those who have learned about climate change prior and are certain of its existence. The authors criticize the surveys and studies that support the consensus, suggesting that the UN’s IPCC is not credible because it is political and not scientific, or that climate scientists are biased in their research. It shocked me that they attacked former Vice President Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” for making “over-the-top-predictions” and relying on the IPCC (a completely valid source) as its main reference. Furthermore, they reasoned that scientists were essentially worrying the public about climate change because they needed funding, and that it is false to claim that the only people who disagree with the issue are funded by the fossil industry. It is these arguments, among many others, that make the book so dangerous, especially in the hands of educators who may be easily swayed into believing the wrong idea.

        <br><Br>

I hope for the sake of our planet’s future that the book has not persuaded the future leaders of our country that climate change is just another political agenda that needs debating on. It is a very real issue that we need to act on now without being held back by conservative (and false!) propaganda.

I do agree that you should always take look on both sides of the perspective when arguing. However, like you said, climate change is happening now. There is no need for arguing whether or not climate change exists. I also agree that the distribution of Heartland Institute's "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" to K-12 teachers are damaging to the idea that climate change is real. If it is able to be argued, some may think that climate change isn't real, which is what our goal shouldn't be.

It is scary how many people believe anything that is put in front of them, Educators especially. This book seems like it is credible. It comes across as confident and factual, but it has so many flaws and is basically an attempt to create chaos and sway the minds of the children in the public education system. I know that if a teacher in one of my first couple years of high school would have told me "climate change is false" I wouldn't have questioned it. It's sad and misleading and wrong.

The only thing that I think we should consider is the displacement of the millions of people who are going to be out of a job. Yes, it seems like a very trivial thing to think about in the long run, considering it's the planet that we're talking about, but it's a very big deal to the millions of people will be out of a job and will have no means for supporting themselves nor their families. There're many people who don't agree with what the company that they're working for does, but in the interest of having a home and food, they stay with their job. Without a solution for these millions of people, we'll never get them to agree that there's a problem so that they can even begin the process of fixing it.
<br><hr>
First off, I just wanted to express that I am grateful that Ken this week is showcasing all sides of the argument behind the realness of climate change to us as a class. It is important to be able to fully understand an issue to see all sides and form a well rounded opinion. After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I was able to luckily see right through the bias and incorrect information being portrayed in the book. Don’t get me wrong, at times I was thrown off, but I found the irony ridiculous which made it easier to navigate the tricky way the information was presented.  I found it quite ironic that in chapter two the book claimed that “The United Nations’ Intergovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), created to find and disseminate research finding a human impact on global climate, is not a credible source. It is agenda-driven, a political rather than scientific body, and some allege it is corrupt.”. Since the book itself was funded by organizations like the Heartland organization whose agenda comes completely from economic prosperity and the politics behind the economic changes that would occur with sustainable methods, I find it ridiculous that they would publish such a thing. I agree with Enya being in dispute with the distribution of this book since it is spreading false information that has potential to have a huge impact on the climate crisis. The poor education of teachers through the distribution of this book has the potential to be fatal and convince the next generation of nonsense. I hope that teachers understand their importance in the matter and actually research climate change and make an educated decision before falsely educating their students. I, like Enya, was also surprised that the main focus of the book was criticising “An Inconvenient Truth”.  I was initially shocked that a valid source would be chosen, but after further thought I realized that this also serves as the biggest threat. Discrediting such a source, if it was believed, would be a strong piece of evidence to those on the fence. Like Enya highlighted, more irony was expressed when the book claimed that climate scientists were only spreading their findings in attempts for more funding. This is precisely one of the main reasons as to why arguments against climate change are being funded. The economic importance of the current economy to these major companies that are funding such books and other propaganda to be distributed shows their use of funding and why they invest so much in methods like book distribution. I completely resonate with Enya in her worries regarding the sweeping of crucial players in the distribution of incorrect knowledge to the next generation.

I agree with your statement! Like she mentioned, from a young age we are taught to look at both arguments in order to develop our own opinion. With that said, it has always been hard for me to understand the counter argument about how climate change is not real even after reading "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming". I do not understand how the book tries to argue that the IPCC is political and not scientific when climate change is occurring all around us. All people have to do is open their eyes to see that it is a real thing. It is also very worrisome that so many children are being exposed to these "anti-climate change" theories at such young, and impressionable, ages. As a young kid being told all of these things, it would be very easy to just go along with them and believe them as they can be pretty convincing theories especially when you have no previous knowledge on the topic of climate change. These children that are being taught from the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" are the generation of our future and if they are all being raised with this false knowledge we are all doomed.
<br><hr>
I really agree with your idea that we should examine problem and question from different perspective. However, this is not reason for people, especially educators, to be fooled by conservative institution. As a student, critical thinking is valuable and necessary. Questioning the reliability of what we are reading can help us filter out the misleading information. Besides, everyone makes mistakes, which makes it common to see imperfection in the essay that talks about climate change. However, defects cannot belittle virtues, and time will eventually reveal the facts. It would be too late if people wait for time to prove everything. Just simply give a glance about the source of the denialist. They are funded by fossil fuel institution, and we know that these companies will be influenced before any other industry on the way to renewable and clean energy. The profit motivates them to deny the climate crisis. What’s worse, the seemingly reliable references used in this book might have tricked thousands of teachers. But the truth is that many information is referenced from their funder, which resembles quoting my own words when trying to convince other. I hope those people and institution wake up before it becomes too late and stop making profit at the price of future of the earth.

I agree with your statement that we should consider all sides of an issue. We shouldn't blindly believe something without doing more research on the issue.  
        <br><Br>
I respect the book for providing counterarguments to the climate change debate and it made some believable claims like how scientists are biased. I wouldn't be surprised if some scientists only focused on proving their hypotheses while ignoring evidence that disproves it. I disagree with the book when it said scientists have to be experts at every discipline in order to have an opinion on climate change. It's impossible to know everything which is why we have people specialize in different areas of study. I think there's nothing wrong with them sending so many books to teachers free of charge; however, it's bad because it gives these kids a false perspective on the climate issue. Like we said, people should look at issues through different perspectives. If these kids read just this book and aren't exposed to more information about climate change, they will have a narrow-minded view towards climate change.
<br><hr>
At most times, I feel that many of our problems as a society, country or even as a human race  could be solved or would at least benefit from more dialogue between sides. I think that keeping an open mind and educating yourself from all standpoints while thinking critically about what your are absorbing is the only way to figure out the truth. So while it concerns and infuriates me that these books full of blatantly false arguments are being sent to our country's educators, I think the larger issue is that people are not willing to take the time and energy needed to investigate the climate crisis themselves. Those who have not are the ones who are most susceptible to being convinced by books like "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming." 
        <br><Br>

False propaganda exists around every single issue we face today and this is an example of how the rhetoric surrounding specifically climate change is especially good at encouraging doubt. However, with first amendment rights being what they are, and the tendency of these groups to invoke that amendment as as excuse for their propaganda, it is so important to teach children how to process the information that will continue to be thrown at them throughout their lives. There is no easy solution to this book. Restricting the Heartland Institute's right to distribute this material as they please is censorship, and there will always be other books and articles and interest groups ready to spout more lies at people regardless. We can only hope that the next generation (and the current one) is being taught to investigate truth for themselves and not blindly believe the things they read, while providing the other side of this "debate" (the truth) as widely and on as many platforms as possible.

I can also see how the arguments made in this book are very persuasive to those who don’t know much about climate change. It’s easier for people to blame the cause of climate change on natural processes than to accept that our society caused this problem and think about fundamental changes we can make to our lifestyles to at least slow it down. This book is propaganda and preys on the people that won’t do further research about climate change. Even recognizing what the source is should show people that the author and the material are inherently biased - the Heartland Institute is a conservative, climate change-denying organization that even goes as far as to claim that climate change may be beneficial to us. While the organization no longer discloses who their donors are, large oil and gas corporations such as ExxonMobil have contributed to their cause in the past. It is very clear that Heartland’s motives are biased and that they are in the pockets of those who profit from climate change.
         <br><Br>

It is very biased and narrow-minded to assert that the claims made by respected and legitimate scientific organizations (such as NASA, AAAS, and the IPCC) are either false or meaningless. The claim that there is “no consensus” among scientists is false and misinformative. While some scientists may disagree on the exact causes of global warming, the vast majority of them agree that humans are responsible for contributing to this crisis. The author failed to give proof that a substantial number of scientists don’t agree that climate change is due to human causes, and the argument that climate research may be biased undermines much of what science has achieved for humanity and its ultimate goals in furthering our knowledge. The next argument that scientists don’t understand the big picture of climate change because of specialization is a weak one. Likening specialized scientists researching  climate change to a group of blind men describing an elephant is entirely off base. These scientists are experts in their respective fields and the purpose of specialization allows them to work together to understand all of the mechanisms of climate change. It should also be obvious to anyone that natural disasters as enormous as the ones happening in California and Australia are not due to natural causes - especially because the Paradise fire was started by PG&E. Denying climate change is a dangerous mindset to adopt because it downplays the very real threat that climate change has on our planet. This isn’t an issue we can afford to ignore; we don’t have time for politicians to debate its importance or filibuster much-needed climate resolutions. Arguments such as those from the Heartland Institute only serve the interests of oil executives and are harming our efforts to fight climate change.

As you stated, most of us have been taught to analyze both sides to an argument. Most of us have been trained to look at everything like this, and the authors of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” took advantage of this approach. However, they take it beyond this, and treat climate crisis like a conspiracy theory stating it is false on many levels and most of all “corrupt”. They were smart and evil enough to make the book free as a PDF and distribute it to K-12 teachers, policy makers etc. From its ridiculous claims like the world being “CO2 starved” or that the rise in 2 degree Celsius is natural variability, to using words like “wacky” to refer to people, this book is far from a stable argument. By that I mean that the arguments in the book are not backed up by any type of relevant evidence. For instance, in chapter one of the book the authors quote Albert Einstein to invalidate another scientists (Oreskes) argument. The quote says “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong”. As I read this I really thought to myself that this book is such a joke. Climate Change is real and the authors of this book really believe that quoting albert Einstein will strengthen their argument when they only look foolish. However, no matter how foolish this book is, the reality is that it has been distributed to so many in power and educators, as you mentioned and that it is so easy to believe they are correct.

<br><hr>
I agree with all of your points, I strongly believe that you need to be educated on both sides to take a qualifying stance. The article, "Why Scientists disagree about global warming" takes a strong argument about denying the scientific consensus on climate change and makes valid points that may be convincing to many people especially if they are not educated towards the viewpoint of global warming being real. But in my opinion, I believe it is not fair and almost insulting to the teachers and instructors that are in a way required to teach the heartland institutes point of view to their students when they understand both sides and stand with the one that is contrary. Besides, students or anyone else learning about climate change shouldn't just rely on the teachings of one view because the arguments may be biased or noncredible. In this case, the article introduced by professor Ken may show some convincing facts and points but the authors and evidence are not credible which creates some suspicions. 
         <br><Br>

Overall, climate change is a serious crisis and is happening now. Many people have started to take action, but it is not enough and when we have sides it makes it even harder for people to contribute to a green lifestyle. People are confused by these statements and therefore are not settled with one argument which makes it harder for them to act upon one side. The only way we could decrease greenhouse gases is by working together on one side because anthropogenic climate change is not settled science.

Even though the expressed purpose of the article’s free distribution is to facilitate and promote skeptical learning, I also disagree with the distribution of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” to K-12 teachers around the United States. I believed in the truth about climate change before I read this article, and I continue to believe in it. But it is scary to think that this article and narrative was placed in the hands of arguably the most influential figures to our younger generations, teachers.

After reading “why scientists disagree about global warming” I was disappointed that scientists are still saying climate change isn't a problem. In this reading they state the only consensus among climate scientists is that human activities can have an effect on local climate and that the sum of such local effects could hypothetically rise to the level of an observable global signal. It annoys me that this is the only consensus they can find when there is so much evidence that the climate is rising each year. I also believe the IPCC is biased in their research because they can say what they want about climate change and people will believe it.  I hope by reading this article people will realize there's still a long way to go for everyone to believe that climate change is real and happening. This will only hurt the planet as not everyone is on board with doing things to prevent climate change.

In order to come to an educated and decisive consensus on any topic, it is extremely important to know both sides of the situation. "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" takes an anti-anthropogenic climate change viewpoint and provides just about as many statistics, reports, and explanations as do current pro climate change arguments. Much to my astonishment, all the points made in the first few chapters sounded surprisingly logical and fact-based. Emphasis on ''sounded". I couldn't help but scoff at "Heavy government funding of the search for one result but little or no funding for other results.." when many if not most of the books arguing against anthropogenic climate change were and are financed by conservative think tanks who are funded by the fossil fuel industry. They also state, "...the U.S. government alone paid $64 billion to climate researchers," as if it's a bad thing that the government is putting money towards the fate of our future. They're attempt at creating shock by mentioning the $64 billion spent on climate research is comically pathetic when direct and indirect subsidies for coal, oil and gas in the U.S. reached $649 billion in 2015. All of their talk about one-sided climate change research being forced on the public is a hard pill to swallow when over 50,000 copies of the first edition of this book were sent, unsolicited, to elected officials, leaders, and scientists and 300,000 copies of the second edition were sent to teachers. This is a pretty aggressive form of propaganda for a group that strongly criticizes such behavior. I will acknowledge that most of the things stated in this book seemed logical and at least partly factual, however the amount of hypocrisy in their points and groundless arguments are as abundant as the faults they find in pro climate change research.

To be perfectly honest, when I first finished reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change” I even started second-guessing and self-doubting on the legitimacy and the accuracy of the climate crisis. It was almost as if I did not know what to think of climate change now having read this book, and I was confused and internally questioning the reason Ken included this as our reading assignment: Is Ken persuaded by this book and wanted his students to see the double-sided argument concerning climate change? Then after watching Ken’s video introducing the book, I realized that this reading was supposed to serve as a negative example to climate change and to display the fossil fuel companies’ efforts to spread misinformation on the illegitimacy of climate change in order to continue their business and profits from extracting fossil fuels. What really struck and surprised me when I read that book was how well-structured the arguments were that they were all worded carefully and they were supported by seemingly-scientific facts and key points that were more than enough to confuse the readers if they have little to no knowledge in climate change, who often constitutes the majority of the reader group. Even I was somewhat convinced at the end of reading that book that I even started reconsidering the issue of climate change that we talked about so frequently and whether if I was overthinking as well and the climate crisis is really not as horrifying as I previously thought. This book helped me to see the reason and arguments behind a significant number of climate change deniers that I could see where they are coming from with their points. For people who have virtually no knowledge of the climate crisis, it is very easy for them to fall into the argumentative trap illustrated in this book because all the arguments and points made in this book seemed very valid and believable, and the readers’ perceptions and attitudes towards climate change can be easily swayed or persuaded by this book. 

         <br><Br>

Additionally, just like what Ken summarized in the introduction video, this book is an example of the determination of the fossil fuel industries in fostering and funding the climate change deniers and organizations to make it convenient and easy for them to earn huge amounts of profits from extracting fossil fuels even at the heavy price of sacrificing our natural environment in doing so. The fossil fuel interests have only one goal in mind: money. They will do anything even scrupulously for their profits and to make all necessary efforts and even beyond to convince others to believe that climate change is false and a hoax even though it is happening on Earth around us right now. They will do everything they can within the realm of their powers by fair means or foul and influence to misinform policymakers, authorities, and figures in powers on the non-existence of climate change despite obvious signs and events that confirm the existence and high destructiveness of climate change just so they can continue their business and keep reaping profits from extracting and selling fossil fuels. It is just all very unfortunate and tragic in a way how some people, particularly those big influential fossil fuel companies weigh money and financial profits heavier than the safety of all lives on the planet and the ecological balance on Earth. These companies are blinded by the sights of money and profits that they cannot see anything even slightly beyond that. If the planet fails to sustain us and all other lives on it at the end--which it will if we do not take immediate actions to mitigate the damages we had already done to our environment as a result of our industrial development--then this entire situation will be a tragedy of modern humanity as it shows how we ignored the signs and refused to take actions to save our environment until it is too late that we all along with all other lives and species on the planet will suffer from the horrendous consequences of climate change. In a sense, we as humans deserved all of those appalling consequences of climate change since we did not carry out our responsibility on protecting our home environment and ruthlessly destroyed it when we should be cherishing and being grateful towards its nourishment and support of all lives on this planet once beautiful but now subjected to the dreadful anthropogenic activities.

I agree; I also initially wondered why this was assigned as one of our weekly readings, and as you stated, it was so that we can understand the basis of the arguments of climate change deniers. When I first started reading the chapters, I thought it was extremely unorganized and absurd because there were just argument with bullet points underneath. However, as the reading continued, I also noticed how organized and well-researched this book was. It was interesting because to us, climate change is obviously happening in reality, but the book showed that there are also a large amount of counterexamples against the climate crisis.

         <br><Br>

While reading the different proposed arguments, I found it unfortunate and depressing many are still disagreeing with the consensus. For example, the rate of scientists that disagree with the reality of the climate crisis has grown over time. The book provided statistics of how the proportion of papers rejecting the consensus (of climate change) rose from 0 to 6%, while the endorsement of the proposal decreased from 75% to 45%. In addition, the Global Warming Petition Project wrote a statement to discourage the acceptance of the Global Warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan in December of 1997. They did this because many scientists disagree with the claims made by the IPCC, accusing them of having insufficient observational evidence and different values of classes of evidence.
         <br><Br>
I found it interesting about your point of fossil fuel interests and how many deniers reject the climate crisis simply for more money, which I agree with. I find it ironic that many climate crisis deniers claim that the IPCC is purposely being more "alarmist" and exaggerating to governmental bodies that climate crisis is a top priority just so they can receive more money, when in reality, it is actually the deniers that are hunting for more money and funding.

“Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” is a book which written by skeptics to convince the public that none of the climate-changing people see nowadays are human-caused, or at least create doubt among the public about the truth of climate crisis issue, helping fossil fuel interests to continue gain profits. In the book, the skeptics keep pointing out the negative aspects of the published work about anthropogenic climate changes as well as their writers. For instance, they criticized Oreskes’ article “Consensus of Scientists” for it appeared to be “peer-reviewed scientific journal,” but eventually turned out to be not peer-reviewed. They think the article is flawed by saying it “assum[ing] a nonscientist could determine the findings of scientific researches by quickly reading abstracts of published papers.” They also criticized Doran and Zimmerman’s work as none of their survey targets have Ph.D. and so on. Furthermore, they added a detailed bibliography in the book to increase its credibility. By doing this, it is easier for them to convince or confuse the audience with the idea that the climate crisis is not real. They even put up the PDF version of the book online for free, just to let more people see it. 
         <br><Br>
Except all of these, they also send a variety of propaganda about this issue to the teachers, for the sake of brainwashing the children with the idea that “climate crisis is wrong.” Unfortunately, it seems like their strategies are working. According to NCSC, there are about 30% of teachers teach the climate crisis as an issue with two sides, and for the others, they don’t even teach the students about this because they are now confused about the existence of the climate crisis. Furthermore, there are only about 30% to 45% of the teachers in middle or high school agreed with climate change in the range of 81% to 100%.

All of these happened because fossil fuel industries care about their benefits as well as the resources underground. The resources can make them profits, however, when the climate is changed due to their harmful activities, the money cannot bring the perfect living environment for people back.

While reading the article, I found myself a little convinced. I think nowadays it’s so easy to believe things when spoken with confidence and reasoning. Especially with Youtube drama, I have no idea who to believe sometimes because they hold such a strong stance. Most of the drama on Youtube is usually based on someone’s word of what happened. However, in this case, we have all the facts presented to us, and it is up to us to find out the truth. At this point and time, we should not even be debating on who’s right when we have the facts. “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” is not only written by a bias party but funded by industries who benefit from adding to the problem. This book’s main goal is to spread confusion and shape the malleable minds of young children. If you really think about it, there is no seller who would give away that many copies for free to teachers for the heck of it.  When selling a certain good, it is to generate revenue. The book obviously does not make a profit by giving the product away, so their profit must come from elsewhere. I also think this is an interesting topic to learn about in a climate change class. I believe it is important to hear both sides before making an opinion, but also to have a better understanding of why they think the way they do. Even in the documentary, I was shocked how much conviction they have in saying global warming is not real.

<br><hr>

Well said. What I thought was interesting was the marketing of the book. On the cover it reads, “Learn the whole truth about our Earth’s climate” and along with that it is a free pdf that can be easily found. Just in case people decide not to read the entire book, the authors start with the key findings to summarize their opinions. Heck, they used an Albert Einstein quote. In other words, they used a credible scientist in their not so credible book. The rhetoric used was confident, authoritative, and extremely convincing, which is why I think it is disgusting at the fact that some teachers are teaching this. The authors articulately go through each source and study an “debunk” them. So unfortunately, yes, I can see why this book is so convincing, especially for those who are genuinely serious about learning about the climate crisis.

“This book is one of many books that dispels the myth and lye of man made global Warming and climate change At what point, in the, estimated 4.5 Billon years has climate, never change, this book, as many other books found on Amazon.com, that climate. is continually changing, throughout Earth's history and man has no power or ability to do anything to effect it one way or another.” 

         <br><Br>

This is a real review that let me embarrassed and disheartened that some people feel this and think this. While there were comments that publicly disagreed about the book, the amount of comments made by climate deniers and people who believe that the climate crisis is happening were equal.

<br><hr>

The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” intends to convince the audience that scientists have not reached a consensus about the climate crisis among with other claims that disagree that the climate is changing due to anthropogenic reasons. In relation to your comment, I thought about how through education, the climate skeptics have managed to influence people.  In educating people by providing certain texts and making it part of a curriculum usually leads toward an agreement or disagreement with the text along with an understanding of a particular topic. In the case with this book people are being influenced. People being influenced by the climate skepticism varies by age, from children to adults. I can imagine the impact it has on children who barely know anything about the climate crisis. For example, if a book on climate skepticism would be on the reading list of a family member or a friend’s English class, they would start to question the climate crisis and even doubt its effects. I found it important how you noted the statistics of the confusion the climate crisis brings due to this book. This makes me think that what is taught to us from a younger age, in particular the climate crisis, influences what we make of it. In being taught that the climate crisis is urgent and due to anthropogenic activity a young mind can be influenced to act and learn more about it. However, if I were to consider a case in which someone were to learn the opposite, that the climate crisis is a natural cause, they might live is disbelief. In this book being distributed among students and teachers, I can imagine what they think in looking at the claims and the disregarding of certain scientist contribution to addressing the climate crisis. Yet, it is also important to take account of what is happening in the world today, in seeing the world experience natural disasters, loss of species, and other ways in which climate change is happening right now.

This week’s material is different from the previous ones. In the reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” the main focus of the discussion is that a lot of scientists believe that the great global climate crisis is actually a swindle. They ignore the fact that over 97% of scientists have reached a consensus that global warming is already there. What surprised me the most is that most K-12 teachers don’t really know the true facts of the global climate crisis. They barely spend no time dealing with climate change issues, and most of them are confused about the fact about climate crisis themselves. 
         <br><Br>
 It makes no sense to me that the reading is questioning the authenticity of the climate crisis. Throughout the whole reading, they cannot provide a convincing hypothesis or scientific explanation to the readers. Even though maybe I have some bias towards the skeptics, I still believe that 97% of scientists are the ones who hold the truth in their hands. We need to take the issue seriously since if we don’t, we will never make the current situation better in the future. Even if there is still no 100% convincing evidence to prove that global climate change is contributed mostly by human activities, we still need to take action no matter what has caused it.

I agree with what you are saying on many accounts. For instance, it shocked me that teachers who have the power to sculpt young minds that will one day be the leaders of our world are failing the youth by not educating themselves on the issue of global warming and therefore not educating the youth on it either. The Heartland Institute sending this book, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," out to teachers and this being the only information that the teachers read about leads to them only having half of the entire conversation and transfer that half of the conversation onto their students.
          <br><Br>
I would be lying if I said that I wasn't partially convinced by what they were talking about in the book at the beginning, however when I went to look at their resources to check their credibility, most works cited were from the Heartland Institute. In the book they claimed that the IPCC's estimate for "climate sensitivity to CO2 was too high," and claimed that the warming that was occurring was most likely natural than caused by humans because they believe that CO2 is not able to do that much harm alone. It would be ignorant of us to believe that we can put that much CO2 and methane into the atmosphere and do no significant damage.
         <br><Br>
I do believe that most scientist don't have the complete picture of what is going on, because of their specialties they only see the part of the picture that is in their particular field. In the book the authors used the analogy of the blind men touching the different parts of the elephant and using a different word to describe it, and they were all correct. Considering that I do believe that just because one thing is true, it does not disqualify all of the other facts. We need to not overlook this large issue and take action against it rather than speculating and researching whether it actually does exist, because by the time that we come to terms that it does exist it will have gotten worse than it already is.

In the book “ Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming”, it shows that the book that was supported by fossil fuel company refuse to admit the climate crisis. I think it is so misleading for people who learn and read from this book to understand the serious of this situation of climate crisis. It can mislead the young children and teenagers and leave the first impression of climate crisis in their mind. It will be very difficult for them to accept other truth if they get a first impression of which climate crisis is not caused by human action, but by nature variation. In the short video by professor. he points out that even teachers from K to 12 aren’t sure the fact of the climate crisis and may confuse the students. Those students are the one who have the most chance to change the future and adjust the nature. However, they may not have the ability to distinguish which is right and which is wrong on the topic of climate crisis. 
         <br><Br>
We need to take serious, and notify that the climate change is real and is happening. We need to broadcast the right information and accept the truth of it.!

I understand why Ken would want us to read this and I can see how it can be beneficial but it was honestly really hard for me to read. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing. I feel like in political situations it's good to recognize the other side's beliefs and viewpoints but I was just really annoyed by the word choice of this article. I know climate change is real and it basically should be an indisputable fact but when it came to the article questioning the amount of scientists contributing to the consensus they kind of got me thinking more on their side. I would snap out of it when I would read the next line of the article which was often very hypocritical. This book was advertised to be a non-biased point of view without any financial or political ties but we all know who they are funded by and also what type of people the term "climate change alarmist" appeals to. They also kept refuting the IPCC report and other articles by saying that they were mostly based on assumptions and generalizations but the book is doing the same exact thing to undermine the other point of view. One of the biggest generalizations made in the book was, “one can assume a survey of a larger universe of scientists would reveal even less support for the IPCC’s position”. If the authors of this book are so confident about this statement then why hasn't there been a mass survey so we can really see what scientists think, I highly doubt that most of them think climate change isn't real/anthropogenic, especially during today's circumstances.

The basis of this "study" is inherently flawed. And in fact, I wouldn't even call this a study at all. When people who can't do science themselves want to publish something official, they're best option is to knit-pick issues with cherry-picked examples. 
         <br><Br>


Although the authors like to poke fun at political science, they might want to learn a thing or two about it. The public propagation of scientific ideas is inherently limited because, as the study points out, very few people are interdisciplinary experts on subjects. But an infinitely more important issue is that “the public” is almost entirely ignorant and uninterested in the scientific method. Can you imagine if Bernie stood up on the stage and read a scientific paper to a crowd of people? Do you think anyone would have any clue what he was talking about? Of course not. Because nobody without a proper background in science is going to be able to understand the complexities of a study that took years to compile. For this reason, politicians, in order to spread the word, may simplify the issue and use catchy slogans or jarring statistics. Obviously, this is not ideal. Ideally, everyone would read the entire IPCC themselves or conduct their own research, but that is not how our world works. We rely on messengers, such as politicians or non-scientific news to explain major issues in a digestible way. However, pointing out flaws with "popular statistics in the media" does not debunk the science behind climate change. This is what’s so unfair about the study, they place the burden of proof on the democrats to be spreading information that is entirely accurate and in no way “dumbed down” and this study takes the easy way out and just pokes holes in the methods used by liberals. It is significantly easier to call the other side wrong than it is to prove your own side right. That’s why the position of “skepticism” is a cop-out from actually proving anything yourself. In fact, when they ran out of "scientific" criticisms they resorted to unfounded, ad hominem attacks, calling Naomi Oreskes a “socialist historian” to try to make the reader associate her with radical policies. When in reality Naomi Oreskes is a History of science professor at Harvard with absolutely no ties to socialism. A reputable study would absolutely never accuse another academic of "socialism" in a paper regarding science.
         <br><Br>


I'd like to focus on a quote from the study, “Political ideology is the strongest or second strongest factor in determining a scientist’s position on global warming”. As much as I'd love to be "moderate", It's really hard to compare the ACLU (American civil liberties union) who does work to help immigrants and increase worker protections to Big Tobacco or the oil industry. Although both may be considered "political" in their nature, one of them is attempting to better the lives of Americans, while the other is SOLELY seeking profit. This is a really important distinction because even though the IPCC is supported by "democrats" that is entirely because it is of the democratic platform to CARE about the environment. Republicans have always believed that the economy is more important than the environment so it makes sense that they'd support climate denialism. But in this case, the 97% of scientists are not being influenced by political agendas, rather, the democrats align themselves with the science, whereas the Republicans are literally putting words into the scientist's mouths. I audibly laughed at the sentence, “the NIPCC seeks to objectively analyze and interpret data and facts without conforming to any specific agenda. This organizational structure and purpose stand in contrast to those of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is government-sponsored, politically motivated, and predisposed to believing that dangerous humans related global warming is a problem in need of a UN solution.” Ironically enough, the Heartland Institute never made their donor list public until it was leaked from an insider who confirmed that, “Murray Energy bankruptcy filings in 2019 revealed the Heartland Institute received $130,000 from the energy company owned by climate change denier Robert Murray.” Furthermore, they receive donations from Big Tobacco which helps explain the following quote by the Heartland’s president, “Joe Bast claimed that “moderate” smoking doesn't raise lung cancer risks and that there were  “few if any, adverse health effects” associated with smoking.” The irony in this is that the Heartland Institute PRIMARY method of gaining ethos (credibility) is their supposed lack of bias when in reality they are one of the most spineless institutions I’ve ever seen. They are essentially a mouthpiece for right-wing propaganda.

I agree with you and the fact that this study is flawed. This article lacks the same merit that they claim many of the climate change scientists also lack. Rather than using scientific facts to support their argument that the climate crisis isn’t rooted in anthropogenic action, the authors focus on politics and basically use libel to counterargue the climate crisis “alarmists”. I will say that the book was quite convincing at points and denies the arguments of the climate crisis in a convincing manner. 
         <br><Br>

This study, rather than focusing on the facts of climate change and the sources of global warming, focuses on the consensus of climate scientists. This study fails to enhance or bring to light any knowledge on climate change and hones in on the claim that “97% of scientists believe in anthropogenic climate change”. This study fails to support their claim with any specific evidence and focuses rather on discounting climate “alarmists”. 
         <br><Br>

The fact that fossil fuel industries are behind this book and funding falsified information to be widely spread to the youth across America is terrifying. The conservative think tanks are money motivated, therefore do not have future generations or the population in general in mind.
<br><Hr>
I thought your comment was particularly interesting because I had the same thoughts while reading. I was astounded to read that the authors believed that the IPCC is "agenda-driven, a political rather than scientific body, and some allege it is corrupt," when they should be looking at themselves. Almost all of its sources are from Heartland Institute, which is problematic because it would mean that all of its claims are biased towards Heartland's beliefs. I had never heard of Heartland Institute, so I looked it up and Google summarized it as "American conservative and libertarian public policy think tank." This institute is tied to political views, so how can it accuse the IPCC as being corrupt and agenda driven when that's the entire basis of Heartland? Furthermore, their doubts of NASA's claim that 97% of scientists believe in climate change is even more baffling. NASA is not politically affiliated with any party; it is our government's head space research administration--key word: research. With years and years of research that NASA has completed for our country, they choose to neglect this one claim. Their perception is obviously skewed if they choose to go against an administration as accredited as NASA.

         <br><Br>

When the "study" provides that the NIPCC stated that CO2 is a mild gas with diminishing effects, it made me chuckle. If they think that CO2 is that harmless, why don't they provide a study where humans are exposed to large amounts of CO2? Obviously, this is cruel and should never be done, but if the study is saying that it won't affect us, they need to prove it. We simply do not have enough processes in our bodies to carry that much CO2 through our veins and exhale, which makes it a good thing that our air is mostly oxygen and nitrogen. However, with CO2 emissions, it displaces our oxygen and makes it hard to breathe. I wonder if the authors of this study have ever inhaled smoke from a fire. Most people will notice that it becomes increasingly hard to breathe, since carbon dioxide is a direct product of the combustion of oxygen. Their claim that CO2 has no known effects, but they fail to realize that four of the five mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gases. I believe we are on our way to the sixth mass extinction.

Evan brings up some interesting and poignant ideas. It's true that is book is cherry-picking. And, honestly, cherry-picking is the lowest of lows. You could support any argument with hand-picked, unfactual sources. You could write an essay arguing the facts of an article with only that article as a source. I do hope that people can see past this cherry-picking when they find this book in their mail.
         <br><Br>
Some of the examples of cherry-picking were straight-up odd to me. As Ken noted in lecture, the book uses NASA as a source, which is already odd, but then they also diss NASA saying they give false facts. Another odd moment was trying to discredit John Cook because he was a cartoonist. I just had this moment of "yes...and?". How does being a cartoonist impact your ability to be knowledgable on a subject at all? It's insane.
         <br><Br>
I actually do believe these writers are well versed in politics. They know how politics work, and thus they know that the layman does not. They aren't reading off scientific papers (obviously, otherwise their point would be null) they're saying what they want you to believe in a clear, concise, and convincing way all while citing sources so they seem reputable. The average kindergarten teacher is much more likely to read this book than all of the sources listed in it.
         <br><Br>
The idea that being liberal makes you publish about the climate crisis is so funny to me. It's almost as if being extremely well versed in the climate crisis because it's your area of study makes you want to vote for candidates who also believe in it and want to do something about it, which, unfortunately, tend to be mostly democrats. I'd love to see a study that proves otherwise that isn't biased in some way or another. The climate crisis has become politicized, and that's clear cut insane.

<br><Hr>
I really agreed with you when you said that it is significantly easier to call the other side wrong than it is to prove your own side right. That seems to be a large part of their argument. While at times, I would argue that it was effective and at times convincing, like you said, this study is flawed, it a study at all. I also agree with you that the public is not interested in the science and would much rather hear the catchy slogans and statistics. While it’s important for people to do research on these types of controversial topics by themselves and then make a decision of their own, that might be asking a lot from the general population who, again, would rather hear it in a catchy way from people that they deem credible. 
         <br><Br>

I also thought it was interesting that you mentioned that Heartland Institute received $130,000 from the energy company owned by climate change denier Robert Murray. I know that in class, Ken talked to us about the sources and how many of them were linked to the Heartland Institute, that clearly has an agenda. Clearly, they are incredibly biased and it is so strange that they would boast an unbiased position. Thank you for your interesting response.

<br><Hr>

I was thinking the exact same thing about how the NIPCC uses a cheap method in trying to describe ambiguity in scientists' arguments over climate change while providing no research or evidence to back their own argument.  They are clever in making their argument easy to follow and seemingly logical, but as soon as we notice that all their claims are solely built on denial, we start to realize that they have no evidence or research to back their arguments.  "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming" also does a good job in finding complex areas to present their argument where it would be difficult for scientists to argue against because the complexity of the issue is hard to understand.  This works especially well as it's easier for climate change deniers to present a simple and seemingly logical lie than it is for scientists to explain a complicated truth to the public especially when the public wants to believe the lie.  An example is when "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming" argued that EPA regulations to transform the way electricity is generated will have a minuscule impact to help climate change while costing billions of dollars.  It's easy to follow that the government must spend money to run these programs, and it's harder for scientists to measure and present to the public the impact renewable energy will have on the climate as well as to calculate how much the damage from natural disasters from climate change will cost.  

         <br><Br>

I especially like the quote you brought out, “the NIPCC seeks to objectively analyze and interpret data and facts without conforming to any specific agenda."  Knowing that they are affiliated with Heartland Institute and fossil fuels, they should be embarrassed about how they have to lie about such a thing in order to gain support.

<br><Hr>
I agree with your argument in that the article has no real foundation for its information, and that it bases it's argument off of nit picked flaws of a statistic. The Heartland institute published this book to put a crack in the credibility of the climate crisis movement, and therefore weaken its force. It sees the awareness that has risen around the topic in recent years, and rather than turning a blind eye, creates a comeback that questions the severity of it. It pokes holes in scientists findings without providing any finding or real facts against the climate crisis themselves, however it does it in a very smooth audience captivating manner. It touches upon the thoughts that may have crossed a readers mind when reading an alarmist perspective, however rather than just pointing out that alarmists may be over eccentric, it discredits their perspective as a whole.
         <br><Br>
It is insane to see how much politics impact this issue, that a "White America" comes before a " Green America". However this issue should not be political because it will affect the world as a whole, whether liberal or conservative. I find it crazy to see how the Heartland Institute was Abe to get away with sending out their free book to K-1 through 12 teachers, without this it being discussed more prominently as the scandal that it is. I also previously believed that it was common sense for people to know that over 80% of scientists agree upon climate change - with it in fat truly being 97% - and find it interesting that only 30-45% of teachers, with a bachelor degree and teaching credential knew this to be true. The climate crisis will be this centuries biggest issue, and needs to be brought to life with the correct info revolving around it. It scares me to think young students could grow up as blindsided to it as this previous generation was.

<br><Hr>
I agree with you on the fact that because this book "Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming" does not have any scientific basis, it relies mainly on nitpicking and trying to to find flaws in the studies of climate scientists/advocates. What is scary about this document is that the people who wrote it tried really hard and did a decent job. I can totally see how someone who is not knowledgable on the subject might buy into what this book has to say and reject the issue of climate change as needing attention and urgent actions.
         <br><Br>

For example, they have a clear outline with very direct language pointing out different issues like the hyper productivity of alarmists and resume padding and the potential grant-seeking. However, this book was hypocritical in that it pointed out that climate scientists receive huge amounts of funding from the government, since the people who wrote it also received huge amounts of funding from tobacco and fossil fuels companies. And while we can believe that the government, by funding these scientific research, is working in favor of the people and their wellbeing, why would we have any reason to believe that companies like the Koch Industries would do anything that may benefit the masses except to protect their own wealth?


<br><Hr>
I think something interesting that you point out in your comment is that Republicans make it seem as though politics and science need to go against each other, when often in situations like this, they truly go hand in hand. While conservatives try to use the connotation of politicization to their own economic gain, liberals try to politicize issues to disseminate information to the wider public easier. It’s incredibly hypocritical for the Heartland Institute to cherry pick the other side’s argument and argue that this politicization of this issue is wrong when they’re funded by the fossil fuel industry and calling someone a “socialist” as an insult” 
         <br><Br>

To address Ken’s question in the video, it’s incredible concerning that their agenda is to target the youth, impressionable, naive people who are responsible for changing the course of this climate crisis. Education of the youth is one thing that should in no way be politicized and knowing this corruption is funding the big pockets of these “unbiased institutions” is infuriating.

I believe climate change is a justifiably debatable topic. However, I don't think enough evidence exists to refute it. I was fascinated by the points "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" made against the validity of climate change but I was not convinced. First off, I thought the book's introduction comparing the Obama administration's platform focusing on climate change more than ISIS terrorism was irrelevant. I do believe ISIS is a threat to national security, but I don't think it was the right point for the writers of this book to make in their efforts to refute the existence of global warming. This book did an excellent job of explaining how much research has been done regarding climate change. Although I agree with the fact that credibility is important when accepting the existence of global warming, I felt this book didn't do a great job of refuting the credibility of the science in support of climate change. There were a lot of "they are mistaken" and "they are misinformed" quotes, but no hard evidence against the facts. Even if "global warming" doesn't exist, there is no harm in believing that it does as it would only lead to making everyone live healthier lives. But this isn't possible and that fact that this book was most likely funded and sent out by the fossil fuel industry says something about climate change's truth. Why would the fossil fuel industry be so concerned about climate change's validity? As we all know, for its own profit. The fact that tons of K-12 students are being taught that there is zero chance global warming exists is terrifying. The result of this will be another generation of individuals who are completely environmentally unconscious.

After going through the first three chapters, I was astonished by what I have learned regarding the battle between political, financial interest and scientific authority. It’s surprised to find out that there is a group of people who don’t believe in climate crisis. Additionally, this book is given to tons of K-12 teachers which will definitely target at school kids, the future generation who will mainly take the responsibility for making the climate crisis. What’s even starling is that there is a logical reasoning process that persuades audience into believe that there is no consensus between scientist on global warming and it’s a spontaneous metamorphosis as human civilization continues. The authors illustrate ideas like the climate issue is interdisciplinary, and it requires the collective efforts of experts in different fields, as well as there is insufficient evidence being collected. Its’ the first time for me to getting to know IPCC, and I was totally disappointed by its lack of credibility as an authoritative reference. As far as I’m concerned, IPCC involves confirmation bias in which it only finds articles that supports its stand under financial and political reasons. I sincerely hope that we could have more convincing sources and scientific facts in the future, so that people can take actions in return.

I do agree with your point that giving access of this document to those who are teaching our future generation is both pitiful and harmful. Ken continuously tells us that it is up to us, as educated young adults, to help reverse climate change, and the next people in our footsteps are K-12 children. What are we teaching these young children? 
         <br><Br>
The most interesting thing I found in the first three chapters of the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” is that the authors continuously use the term “there has never been any evidence of…” (pg 50). The fact that there is no evidence for something does not mean that it isn’t happening - if your eyes are closed while someone is walking in front of you, that doesn’t mean they didn't walk in front of you, it just means that you can’t see it. These authors need to open their eyes.
         <br><Br>
Along with this comes the authors idea of “evidence-based policy-making”, in which they claim (on page 41) that policies can only be made if there is evidence as to why a certain policy should be made. In some regards, I do understand this, but this reigns different for a discussion about climate change. For this instance, there is no policy being made regarding climate change because the law-makers are the ones benefiting from the causes of climate change, NOT because they can’t agree whether it is real and harmful. As Vicky brought up, the authors of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” are gaining political and financial support by writing this book. The benefits for these people are outweighing the real and true consequences of climate change. Still, even after reading the first three chapters, I fully stand with the idea that climate change is real and harmful.

<br><Hr>
 I really appreciate your point in stating that no evidence doesn't mean that nothings happens. People tend to validate their viewpoints using evidence that are supportive of their stand and neglect other facts. From the side of the audience, it's wise to evaluate a statement from both positive and negative aspects. As the saying goes, every coin has two sides.

In the reading that was due this week, there were many believable claims that climate change isn’t real. For example, Oreskes’s scientific research includes opinions from scientists and nonscientists. This makes me, a reader question the credibility of someone’s scientific article if they provide opinions rather than experimental facts that have not been proven incorrect. This reminded me of the film for the first week because they used Leonardo DiCaprio as the spokesperson when a lot of people claimed what does he know when he’s not a scientist. Personally, I think the authors of this book are really good at persuading the readers that many statistical findings were only one-sided and why surveys ask certain questions while avoiding questions that have more depth. While reading, I thought “Am I only thinking about climate change based on what one side said or am I thinking it thoroughly as an individual?” As I continued to read, there was one quote “Climate scientist, like all humans, can be biased” and this made me speechless because the reason they wrote this book was that they were also biased thinking that climate change isn’t real so I don’t think this statement makes their claim stronger. In addition, skeptics were super focused on the fact of being consensus and since not 100% of scientists believe that climate change is occurring now and due to human factors, it gives them leeway to argue that climate change is a hoax from the “fake” scientist. Overall, the book was carefully constructed to challenge readers who do believe climate change is real because they provided so many numbers and questions that question the reality and truth about climate change. I think they did a good job using the fact that some used facts that not peer-reviewed and they didn’t want to share where they got their information, making them suspicious.

Learning the fact that many K-12 teachers don’t know whether climate change is real made me shocked because I didn’t know that they didn’t need to know about climate change. I thought that at least the science teachers in middle school and high school would talk more than just one hour on climate change but thinking back, I don’t recall any of my science teachers talking about climate change for a long period. They might have just addressed it briefly but never went into detail and I didn’t think too much about it until watching Ken’s video. I think teachers, especially science teachers, should take Ken’s online class about climate change in order to fully understand the concepts of climate change since based on statistics, teachers really don’t know much about climate change right now and how it would affect the following generations that are coming.

While reading Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, I had an uncomfortable feeling of immense frustration. I've known about for years now and have spent a lot of time researching and discussing the topic. My opinion that anthropogenically caused climate change is real is cemented. However, I realized as I read through a very well thought out article countering my opinion on what I believe to  be the most pressing issue of our time. What really infuriated me was the realization that I really don't know the truth. All I've done is taken other people's word for it, credible or not. I always assumed the other side of the argument would be sloppy and emotional, and obviously in support of the fossil fuel industry that supports them. While I understand that the Heartland organization is indeed in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry, once again I am only taking Professor Hiltner's word for it, I don't actually know with all certainty. It is time that the articles produced in support of climate change belief provide the raw data, but also help the reader learn to analyze this for themselves. I understand that to grab the attention and the support of many, this simply isn't possible, but for those that are intrigued and want to be able to understand the facts at a deeper level, it would be nice for sources like these to be more accessible to the informed and interested public.

After reading that climate skepticism book, I can see how people are convinced to deny anthropogenic climate change saying that climate change is simply a natural occurrence.  What I also noticed is how well put together it was.  Most of the time when I think of climate deniers I’d think of those who simply don’t want to accept what is happening in the world or those who scramble to put together arguments against why anthropogenic climate change isn’t real.  However, with the book Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, that was not the case.  It used studies and mounting evidence in support of their position, piece by piece dismantling the argument for anthropogenic climate change based on the statistic that 97% of scientist agree upon it as a census.  With that it does a convincing job at persuading the reader to also become a skeptic.  It’s no wonder they sent it to K-12 teachers in the hope of planting a seed of doubt in the minds of not only adults, but that of American’s youth.
         <br><Br>

One thing that surprised me after watching Ken’s video was that there are actually states in the US that have legislation in support of climate skepticism as it should be taught in school, for some in addition to the argument for anthropogenic climate change, but for others in replacement of it.  It really shows how deeply rooted the belief against anthropogenic climate change is, so much so that it is reflected in the teaching of the future generations of America.  This is also scary because while mine and future generations are supposed to be those combatting the climate crisis, in school the youth are being taught that it is not a problem.  This is a major issue.  How can the burden of responsibility of climate change fall on the younger generations when they are being taught that the reality is that it isn’t an issue?  How will any changes be made?  We are responsible, but if it is instilled in us that it isn’t an issue, no changes will be made, and the effects will only continue to increase exponentially as time goes on.  Then comes the question: when will we finally realize that anthropogenic climate change is real and has been happening for decades and finally make lasting global changes?

I am totally agree with you. Since teachers are the people whom the students trust the most, what they are doing affects great portion of their students. Therefore, if the teachers are not conscious about the true causes of the climate change, they should not easily told their students about the answer of it. However, currently what they are doing  is actually misleading their students, bringing them into a wrong path. These children are our future, and if they are misunderstanding about this issue, who are supposed to take care of it? Also, it is really hilarious that most of those books that are denying that the climate change is cause by human are funded by fossil fuel industry. If they continue fooling others, especially children, they are actually committing a big "crime". They can cover this issue for just a moment, but what they do not know is that this kind of action will take many years to pay it back, to get it back on the right track.
<br><Hr>
thank you for sharing and I completely agree with you on how climate skepticism is actually pretty convincing if judging it based upon its arguments and evidence. To my surprise, climate skepticism work "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is a book that is very well-written with very carefully-constructed arguments and strong supporting evidence, so it is very difficult for the readers to distinguish the truth from lies and facts from misinformation in this case because this book seems too credible, too scientifically proven, and too well-structured to be wrong and misinformed. I have to admit that after reading that book even I myself had the thought of rethinking the issue over climate change and whether if it is really as devastating as many portrayed or it is just overrated as the climate change deniers claimed. I was almost convinced by this book had I not reminded myself of looking over the lecture notes for this class and doing research online regarding the legitimacy of climate change. This book, again, shows the extent that the fossil fuel industries are willing to go in order to continue their business, that is, continue to extract and sell fossil fuels even though our environment is suffering tremendously from such actions. Reading this book makes me realize that it is crucial to always keep a clear, objective head when reading things like this book and to always question ourselves the credibility and practicality of the arguments and most importantly, to have the skill to distinguish facts and truth from misinformation and falsehood.

I completely agree, it is truly impressive how well of a job they did at providing a compelling case against anthropogenic climate change. When I had heard the statistic that 97% of scientists agreed on the issue of ACC, I was actually quite surprised -- considering the amount of skeptics on the news. Naturally, this was a good point to start their argument with, since intuitively it made sense. I also thought the idea that climate science is interdisciplinary was a good point, and it must be difficult for someone to accurately form hypotheses over such a complex process. However, as I read further it progressively got more radical -- claiming that the Earth was changing due to "natural" forces and that there was no evidence of human effects on the planet. The most absurd part of the article though had to be their argument on the liberal political agenda of the IPCC. I found this to be incredibly ironic, considering the huge amount of scientists and politicians being secretly funded by fossil fuel industries. However, for conservative individuals or even just people that don't like politics, this would be a selling point if they hadn't been swayed already. It is really upsetting that these skeptic messages are being sold to people around the country when we are already so far behind in reducing our emissions. I agree with you that it is scary, it seems that no matter how hopeful I might get about resolving the issue, I learn more that just keeps making matters worse. It is sad to see how our society has become so materialistic and addicted to fossil fuels, that we can't see all the horrible things going on around us. It is unfortunate that the majority of these people will only wake up when it is too late, but even worse, that the people who have woken up and want to do something about the issue are vastly overpowered due to grand schemes like this.

I remember when I was growing up, teachers were revered as gods in my household. My parents believe that I should always listen, respect, and look up to my teachers. Naturally, I listened to my parents (like the good child that I was) and I took all of my teachers extremely seriously. Everything that they ever said, no matter if it was their opinion or facts from the textbook, I automatically believed. They were the sources of information; the keys to academic success; the keepers of knowledge. 
         <br><Br>


When I heard Ken talk about teachers, I immediately thought back to my childhood; to the time when I believed that my teachers were the smartest people in the room. If a state’s curriculum did not include the harms being done to our climate, but instead, told 6th graders that it was a hoax, then I would’ve believed it and brought that with me throughout the rest of my schooling. If my teachers were ambiguous on the topic or sprinkled their own political flavor into their teachings, then I would have gone my whole life believing them. 
         <br><Br>


Teachers hold a special place in my heart because of the knowledge they have given me. To think that there is a child like me - a child who believes that their teacher is their hero - listening to their teachers talk about how climate change is not real, it saddens my heart. As a child, what people say is often louder than what they see. And to imagine that they will live their lives denying climate change, telling their parents that it is not that serious, and to say that what they say is fake. Lives are changed by a teacher’s words. Those words should not be used to dissuade climate change.

I agree with many of the comments you made about this week’s reading. I had no idea how big of a business climate change denialism was. After knowing the facts; however, I started to understand. Many of the authors that are behind the articles that debunk the climate crisis are being funded by fossil fuel industries. For fossil fuel industries, funding anti climate crisis supporters makes total sense. This funding is only a small price to pay if it means that they stay in business and the public is unsure of what to think. It proves that the fossil fuel industry’s priority is making money, not the well-being of our Earth.
         <br><Br>

I had no idea how sneaky climate change deniers were. Their strategies are wiser than their ideas. It made me furious when I found out that climate change deniers are trying to focus on the future of America, children. Books, like the ones we read this week, are being handed out to the teachers around the nation. This made me think about my own childhood. I remember believing that teacher could do no wrong. As a child, if I was told that CO2 was “Essential to life: we breathe it out, plants breathe it in. They call it pollution. We call it life,” I would have continued to live the rest of my life thinking that CO2 was helping our planet. Educating America’s youth with false information will only create a snowball effect where more and more people think climate change does not exist. Climate change is being taught as a two-sided argument when it shouldn’t be an argument at all.
<br><Hr>

I agree with you, in saying how you could see how people are convinced to believe that climate change is due to natural variability and not due to human causes after reading this book. To be frank, about a quarter through the readings they had me second guessing my own belief in the current climate crisis and that human intervention may not be a major cause. I quickly snapped myself back to reality. However, I thought to myself after completing the reading if I would have thought different if I had heard the argument of climate change deniers and skeptics before being revealed to the real implications of the climate crisis through this class. I honestly would have either sided with them, or been a product of their agenda, a skeptic. That just makes me fear for our future generations of children that are being exposed to the spread of misinformation. Similarly to as Ken stated, children will believe the majority of what their teachers say because they trust them, as any child would. It is very scary to think that future generations will grow up to become skeptics or deniers, which would further complicate and quite possible hinder any real implementations to mitigate climate change. This was a very interesting set of readings/films this week and I am very curious to hear what Ken has to add on during lecture.
<br><Hr>

The thing I perceived as most alarming is the immense complexity that was underlying the arguments in the book. I bet that for any readers who do not read the book having a critical and skeptical view the books makes very compelling arguments and is likely to convince you that anthropogenic climate change is not real. Not even going in on the many statistics and various sources the book credits (making it seem very well researched and legitimate) the target audience is very clear. They are not looking to convince our generation, the ones already alarmed. They are trying to influence teachers, and in doing so the next generation. As you said it is shocking that there is any real legislation supporting claims that climate change is a natural occurrence. No governmental institution should be relying on false information as in doing so one of the sources that people trust the most will be polluted. This benefits climate skeptici like Trump who can in turn discard scientist who alarm us about climate change as fake news. Sadly I have to admit that the book is so well put together that it will probably accomplish its main goal in convincing people that climate change isn't real.

In the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, the author tried to convince people that the crisis that we are facing is not that severe. First, in the book, the author argued that there is no consensus among studies in order to use it as a weapon to blur people’s vision to see the truth. In the second chapter, he introduced several reasons for why scientists cannot find agreements among themselves. The author used the famous tale of a group of blind men touching various parts of an elephant to view those scientists as blind men who only knew few things in their own expertise and not having a big picture of “what is truly going on”. 
         <br><Br>


In the video, I was surprised that how much of an impact those affiliates have in today and what they have done to our lives. This phenomenon worries me. How could we allow those things to happen and being misled by those people? Imagine how far will they get to protect their own interests? I think someone need to do something about this, not only for our climate, but for ourselves.

After reading what was assigned of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I felt feelings similar to those you’ve described at the end of your statement. Although throughout the three weeks of class we’ve had so far, I have felt, at times, that Ken’s lectures were designed purely to enact a state of panic in the minds of his students in hopes of change, reading this made me understand why. Panic and fear does inspire people to make changes, but a large part of the reason his method of instruction has seemed so harsh is because of people and groups like the Heartland Institute. I am personally not one of them, but I am sure that there are people in this class who think the climate crisis has no real basis, and I now understand that Ken has really been trying to get these people to open their minds. The Heartland Institute, in this book and in their many other attempts to sway people into disbelief about the climate crisis, does have an amazing tactic of shaking the platform of what we thought we knew and using this confusion to persuade uncertain readers to believe what they have written. The fact that they have such an immense backing and funding is very frightening because they will always be able to spread their harmful messages to people like teachers who influence so many young kids. The way in which they present their message (like comparing the elephant tale to scientists) makes it hard not to pay attention and even partially agree, which makes them that much more threatening.

<br><Hr>

To be honest, I wasn't very aware that there isn't a general consensus on the climate crisis and I was really shocked by the way this week's reading used it against the climate crisis. However, I did feel pretty disappointed that the author was trying to use this "consensus" argument to convince people that the climate crisis isn't as severe. 
         <br><Br>
The way I think of it, I think that there isn't a general consensus because the climate crisis is so multifaceted and severe. Climate is an interdisciplinary study that requires the research from professionals of varying backgrounds. It just disappointed me to read that the author was truly trying to use that against the crisis.
         <br><Br>

To respond to your last paragraph, I agree, power is a crazy thing especially when it's in unfit hands. People have been trying to do something about this, but just as the percentage of those who believe anthropogenic climate change is real grows, the percentage of those who don't is also growing.

<br><Hr>
I completely agree with your response.  The first three chapters of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” also left me in shock; not only did the author use convincing rhetoric to try and give a case for the lack of evidence for global warming but an uneducated population could easily use this to reinforce their views.  I think that the use of the famous elephant tale was a perfect analogy for this phenomenon; if an uneducated person reads this, they will immediately use this to justify the inaccuracy of climate change.  However, someone with background knowledge of climate change will realize that this is an irresponsible use of the analogy because the climate scientists are not blindly touching the subject, they are using their own knowledge to convey the massive scale of climate change that no individual can truly grasp on their own.
         <br><Br>


Similarly to you, I was surprised by the scale of impact these affiliates have in our lives.  What worries me more, however, is how the youth is not being properly educated on the repercussions of climate change.  I think that this phenomenon is so bizarre and scary that the reality of what will happen if the youth is properly educated is appalling.  No one in the older generation wants to tell the youth that the price of industrialization and economic growth might be human ability to inhabit the earth; no one wants to tell the youth that if change is not made now they and subsequent generations may not have a planet to live on.  However, I do not think that fear outweighs the costs of miseducating the youth.  In reality, the upcoming generations will have to reverse or mitigate the impacts of climate change if they want to continue to survive as a species.

I actually hate this reading. I found the whole thing to be very hard to follow and depressing. All the reading does is negate a bunch of other writings. This article confuses me massively. Are they trying to say that all of our evidence is based off of essays that are citing “studies” that may or may not have been conducted? I also thought it would be some type of crime to say “97% of scientists agree,” but apparently it is not. On top of that, the fact that the evidence we are using only acknowledges alarmists as opposed to the skeptics is also concerning. Our beliefs are based on these naïve college essays. I don’t know how this piece grabbed attention because I found it very dull. 
         <br><Br>

I don’t know why it makes me so upset, but realizing we spent 64 billion dollars over a couple years just to analyze all of the human impacts as opposed to acknowledging the environmental influences is triggering. You can’t help but ask yourself “who let this happen?” There’s a couple of questions that come to mind. If there are that many skeptics out there, then why did we waste SO much money on the issue. And secondly, if we were researching an issue with that large of budget, why didn’t we consider every possible outcome. Instead, we just looked at humans. That makes me want to yell. 
         <br><Br>

Climategate was very interesting to read about. Honestly anything “gate” interests me. They literally tried to silence the voice of people that do not believe in climate change just so their own beliefs could prosper. How can they punish people for publishing unpopular opinions? Reading about the money and sponsorships of articles and what not did not help me feel better either.

After reading reading the article “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” I am surprised by the fact that there are still groups of people denying that the global warming is happening. As states in the first chapter “Consensus,” the writers provides me with so many evidence that even though many celebrities claim that 97% of scientists believe that the global warming is happening, there are only 7% of scientists from 2004 to 2007 who endorse the consensus explicitly. This data looks convincing but the statistics the writers cite is obviously out of dated. The writers do not provide us with the latest opinions of scientists towards global warming but try to mislead us to a fallacy that global warming does not even happen. I cannot  imagine what they can obtain by ignoring the phenomenons due to global warming happening around us.
         <br><Br>

Another thing that surprises me is what Ken says in the lecture video that there are a lot of teachers in private or public schools that deny climate change by teaching their students that human activities are not fiercely enough to result in climate crisis. I am kind of worried about if people attach importance to climate crisis since some of them have been misled in their childhood. It is really sad to realize that some schools are using the textbooks that deny climate change and teach their students the wrong facts, give bad impact on their opinions of climate change.

I agree with you. Reading the first chapter, "No Consensus," I was dumbfounded that scientists disagree that the combustion of fossil fuels does not affect climate change as they are a huge cause due to the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In the second chapter, "Why Scientists Disagree," I was also surprised by the fact that groups of people are denying global warming. The research the IPCC conducted was very political for them to try and discredit the human population for not impacting climate change. Climate scientists are gonna be biased because they are the ones that are actually looking into the problem but the cause of them being biased is because of their political views and their tendency to interpret new evidence to confirm their beliefs or theories. Politically, conservative republicans tend to not believe in climate change compared to liberal democrats who 95% do believe in climate change.
         <br><Br>


In the lecture video, I was also surprised reading that teachers in public and private schools deny climate change to their students. This is misleading because as kids that's where we learn and develop morals. Being surrounded around little kids and having only one adult, the teacher, to listen to they are the only source of the belief that we look at. It's sadder to see that textbooks are also not believing in climate change.

After reading the article and watching the lecture video, I was surprised by the number of the teacher and climate experts who themselves are confused about whether it is caused by the nature or human activity. These people are all professional ones for we normal people, so that most of us always believe what they said, especially for those teachers for young students. Those young students do not have the ability to distinguish right from wrong they just totally believe what the teacher said. If the teacher are confused themselves could be a really great problem for those young students, and these students are the one who are responsible in the future to change the future of the earth, so they must get the right information.
         <br><Br>

Furthermore, I agree with the article that the fossil fuel companies influence the public view on this problem regarding climate change a lot. Because these companies depend on the interest of the fossil fuels, they will never say that using these fossil fuels can cause climate change, so they address the cause of the climate change to the nature. I think a important thing is that they do not realize the significance and serious of the issue that it is related to the survival of human beings. Maybe, if they realize this, they will not sacrifice the survival of human-beings just for the interest.

I agree with your comment in the way that it is surprising how some teachers still give out misinformation, or no information at all about the climate change issue. I think it is important for teachers to not only understand this issue, but also spend enough time talking about climate change in order for the next generations to continue the fight for a better earth. It is nice to see that in universities today, the courses of environmental science and climate change are being offered in so many schools. This is essential for our world to be informed about the issue, causing more and more people to be educated about the issue.
         <br><Br>

Also, I agree that the fossil fuel companies are only seeking the most profitable methods for them, rather than ones that may save our planet. If we keep talking about it, and electing people of power to stop such an environmentally damaging practice, then our world can see the change that it needs.

First off, even though the book was sent to 300,000 teachers and possibly teaches 10,000,000 children the wrong facts about climate change, Ken fails to mention that this number is PER YEAR.... these teachers could possibly be teaching these same facts year after year, for decades. Ken told us to read the amazon reviews, and to my alarm, more than half of them stated that the book was truthful and recommended it to others on Amazon under the guise of 'discovering the truth.' I really hope that most of these teachers are smart enough to do their own research and not get swayed into believing these lies. I gotta hand it to the Heartland institute though, they know how to present lies in a believable fashion. When reading the book, it sounds very scientific and believable. I know that many people probably got persuaded of these false claims, but let's all hope that the number isn't very high. I bet there are a few people in our class of 800 that actually believes this stuff themselves!

After reading the first three chapters as well as watching ken’s video, all I can think is that it’s absolutely insane how far conservative think-tanks will go to deceive people. Their book consisted of random information thrown together to try to make them sound intelligent as well as bad-mouthing climate change experts that have dedicated their lives to their profession. At times when I was reading through their book I would catch myself believing them which goes to show how easy it is to trick the general public. All you need is a few statistics and some reputable names to sound professional. But what frightens me the most is that The Heartland Institute distributed this book to teachers who are in charge of molding the minds of our future generation. It’s one thing to deceive fully grown adults who are capable of reasoning but to mess with children who will believe their teacher is completely disgusting. 
           <br><Br>
 In the book I found myself agreeing with a few of their points such as there is some disagreement among scientists because most aren’t specialized in more than a few fields. While this is true, it’s not fair to say that these scientists aren’t highly regarded because of this. I am extremely frustrated with this reading mainly because our nation is already so polarized and we don’t need more of a debate when regarding the climate crisis.

I completely agree with your comment. It’s quite scary to think about how people with such high status and power can think of so many ways to try and manipulate others. It’s so much worse and a little frightening to know that they target the children - that they know they’re the easiest to influence and are willing to pollute the next generations just to have their way. It’s also concerning to know that most of the sources in this book come from the same roots, but are modified to seem diverse and legit. It puts in perspective how much research we have to put in to really get down to the facts. It’s very eye-opening and very scary to know there’s people out there that promote this and what these people stand for. It’s especially hard to comprehend how they just tricked people into actually teaching this and have them eat it up and believe it’s all true.

In the book “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming”, there is a denial of the climate crisis published by a fossil fuel affiliate. The reason they give out mainly stressed that human behaviors may not be powerful enough to affect the global climate in general compared to natural variability. Also, there is no direct evidence towards global warming. The author’s tone in this book kind of remains neutral. He seems to remain in an unbiased position pointing out how the assertion about global warming is not evident and present a number of evidence. I feel the opinions in the book are reasonable to some degree.
           <br><Br>

 However, in the video, I am surprised to learn that fossil fuel affiliate also has teachers in schools to propagate their ideas that the climate crisis is not real and not caused by human beings. I am kind of frustrated about such a phenomenon.

I found it absolutely disgusting that the author of this book is so good at convincing the reader that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the world, that climate change is not caused by human activity nor inherently dangerous, and that the scientists are all wrong. I appreciate that Professor Hiltner brought up the laws regarding teaching about the climate crisis in Virginia and other traditionally conservative states , for example.  Because of people like the author of this book, and the influence the (rich) fossil fuel industry has on our politicians, laws are being passed around the country ensuring that our nation's underage students are being taught inaccurate information about the climate crisis. It is abhorrent that these people are getting rich off the suffering of others, and are professing a false narrative that everything is fine, when in actuality we're not fine. The planet is not fine. The fossil fuel industries getting billions of dollars in profit is not fine. As Greta Thunberg says, our house is on fire. I agree with you, Echo, that it is extremely frustrating that these fossil fuel affiliates are responsible for getting our teachers to teach inaccurate information about the climate crisis.

I completely agree to this comment and I do think that climate crisis deniers  main argument is that human behaviors aren’t powerful enough to affect that global climate compared to natural events. I can see where they are coming from with that argument I mean the Earth is huge and it seems like it would take a lot of damage to really make an impact but obviously we have without a doubt. There are 7.8 billion people on this earth and if they don’t think we can’t make that much of an impact than they’re wrong. I also agree with this comment about the author’s tone. He seemed fairly unbiased and mainly stating facts and evidence which is a lot better than an argumentative tone in my opinion. I did not like the fact that the book targeted children especially because it is hard for them to change their opinion when they grow older even if they become more educated on the fact. If young teachers are teaching this to their students, then the students will believe it even more and won’t have the passion or desire to make changes for their own environment. The only reason companies are doing this is to maximize their profit. Thankfully, almost half of readers gave this book one star.

This article truly left me feeling confused. I am guilty at times 2of just accepting a lot of information given as facts and not looking into the source or accuracy. I think many people are this way too, which in the case of climate change, can be good or bad; it just means whatever people hear more of they are likely to accept. I always accepted the “97% consensus” claim, but reading this article makes me doubt that and other “facts” I have been hearing. Even though I am aware that this is written by skeptics, many of the concerns they were raising seem completely valid. Statistics given by “alarmists” may not be lies, but there are ways to skew results such as releasing opinion essays versus peer-reviewed papers, conducting voluntary or selective surveys, or picking and choosing which research is published for the public. It makes sense that climate change activists would put more effort into publishing work over skeptics, but the unequal ratio makes it hard for everyone to get a big picture of everything and form their own opinion on the subject.
           <br><Br>

“Political ideology is the strongest or second strongest factor in determining a scientist’s position on global warming” … that quote from the article makes me feel extremely concerned, because to me, scientists should be releasing unbiased SCIENCE. Science should not be debatable. However, scientists are people, so natural bias is bound to happen, in which case there needs to be a diverse group of scientists conducting research. On top of that, we may need to pair up scientists with opposing views, that way one can conduct an experiment and the other can interpret the data to ensure there is little bias involved. The article stated that the survey finding the 97% consensus was made up of mainly liberals. I do think climate change believers look for research that proves their side as opposed to just pure research without knowing or planning results, and deniers would do the opposite. The fact that politics are getting in the way of science and truth is really a shame and something that needs to be addressed. The only way to move forward is to work together, skeptics and activists, to find some sort of agreement. I am not suggesting we compromise on such a crisis, but I do not believe we can move forward with such a division.
           <br><Br>

I really like that Ken had us read this. We are not just given one side of the “debate” and told to believe it completely. Seeing everything out there about climate change, or at least as much as possible, whether it be from “alarmists” or “deniers”, will help all of us form our own educated opinion on such an important topic.

I completely agree with everything you stated above. It is important to be informed of the multiple sides of every argument, and I am grateful Ken provided this reading as part of our class content. While reading the article, I did find myself taking note of how well-written it was, and how it seems to build its main ideas upon a plethora of evidence. However, upon further analyzing it, I realized that the so-called "evidence" was not only hypocritical, but false. A major part of the paper discusses the inadequacy of utilizing surveys as evidence, yet almost all of the evidence provided by the authors was from surveys. Surveys are not a proper way to collect this type of data. People often alter their opinions on surveys to what they think the provider wants to hear, or often times many of the possible answers provided don't even match the survey-takers beliefs. Along with this, one of their main arguments was how much funding was going into the study of climate change, and that scientists were corrupted. But the money provided for this type of research does not directly go to the scientists, it goes to bettering their research equipment, hiring more people to learn what they can about climate change, and to protecting the future of this Earth. It felt incredibly hypocritical for this to be one of their key points considering they are funded by fossil fuel companies....(AND now won't release who gives them funds, which I would infer to mean they are being funded my major fossil fuel and conservative corporations). 
           <br><Br>

On top of this, the knowledge that they worked to try and prove that second hand smoke is not harmful disturbed me. I find this to be a major red flag, as well as a reflection of where this organizations loyalties truly lie. (aka $$$$$$$$). I also agree with you, Abigail, on the aspect of transparency. Research on climate change needs to be transparent, in order for them to gain the trust of the people. And in many cases, scientists are transparent. But, there still needs to be more openness with climate change even if the truth is scary. People have a right to know what is happening to their home, the Earth.


<br><Hr>


I find it almost funny that the reason you are saying that this article is inaccurate is due to their evidence coming from surveys, which is exactly what the authors of the article were complaining about "alarmists" doing in the first place. Their issue is that the 97% consensus came from a selective, biased group of scientists being surveyed, but then in turn they used surveys to build their case back against them. Clearly they are being hypocritical, which you said, so I totally agree with you.

Both the author and the company writing and funding the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” should be condemned. There are a lot of viewpoints from this book that seems right at first sight but easily refutable if the reader has some background knowledge and the ability of reasoning. However, the book mainly targets on children, who have little or no insights to the concept global warming. Some might have heard of the word, but just a vague concept. This book providing falsified information has a great impact on children, because the information young children perceive is very difficult to change from later education they acquire. With the neglection and ignorance of global warming, these children are not likely to have any sense of responsibility to protect the environment when they grew up. Instead of living a low carbon-emission lifestyle, they are more likely to enjoy the benefits and convenience of overusing fossil fuels. As a result, the fossil fuel companies that funded the book, and other around 80% of books that denies global warming, will receive a much higher profit from the people they misled. 
           <br><Br>

Moreover, this kind of books are also targeted on teachers of young students. Even those who initially believe this existence of global warming will feel confused. They want to offer correct information to their students, when they become skeptical towards global warming, the knowledge they teach also leads that way. All teachers in US might influence half of the local generation. Half of the young generation are equipped with false knowledge and ignorance of global warming. Teacher can be one of the most trustworthy persons to a child, so the child would perceive the knowledge as true. Children loves to talk about what they have learned at school and they would tell their parents what their teachers said. Consequently, parents, another group of people that trusts the teachers most, will have the impression that global warming is not a thing to be worried about. Who benefits? The fossil fuel companies funding the book. 
           <br><Br>

This situation is disgusting. It is not just a method of advertising but has risen to a moral level. These companies are using the innocence of children and the most basic trust between human to maximize their profit. They are sacrificing the future of humankind to get as much as money for their relatively short lifetime. One thing that comforts me is that 40 percent of the readers of the book gave a one star, suspecting the reliability of information and the real purpose of publishing this book, as well as offering correct information and explanation about global warming. It is good to see that there are still clear-minded people, even under the influence of false information. Although it’s just 40 percent by now, hopefully one day most people would be clear of what is really going on.

After reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” I felt immensely unsettled. I could not believe that the sole purpose of this book is to make people question whether anthropogenic climate change is real. I found it disturbing that the authors primarily target teachers and that the Heartland Institute even sent the book to many teachers. It is amazing how easily people, even teachers, will trust information from a source with an official-sounding name, like the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). I think you made a good point when you discussed the possible implications of this book on students. Students typically trust their teachers and as a result, believe what they are taught by their teachers. However, even teachers are being misled and bought off by sources of propaganda such as this book published by the Heartland Institute. This is especially concerning since children are the future and are tasked with combating the climate crisis.

           <br><Br>

I was also disturbed to learn that according to a 2013 study, roughly 87% of books that deny climate change are financed or published by conservative think tanks funded by the fossil fuel industry. It amazes me just how much wealth is in the fossil fuel industry and how those in the fossil fuel industry use this wealth to influence policymakers and others in positions in power. This ultimately allows those in the fossil fuel industry to make even greater profits and leads to a self-perpetuating cycle that benefits the fossil fuel industry at the expense of the environment and everyone else.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment about the companies using innocent children for their own personal gain, this came to mind as well when I was doing the reading. It was pretty smart of them to distribute the information that they wanted to be known instead of the actual truth, but it would’ve been smarter to have actual fact checkable information, that didn’t come from their own source. 
           <br><Br>
I’ll admit, when I first skimmed through this without looking too much into it, what Ken said during lecture was true and I found myself in a daze. But after going back and looking at the sources and realizing they mostly all came from the same place, their own organization that printed the book, everything became much more clear on how this is just information that they want the public to believe so they can profit from it in the future.
<br><hr>

I wouldn't say that this book is a terrible threat. Children, who are the most impressionable people on the planet and who will have the most influence on climate change in the years to come, aren't going to find much interest in it. It's boring. There's no pictures. There are a lot of words. The statistics are confusing. Children aren't going to want to read it, aren't going to care about what it's talking about, and in fact might even get annoyed by its sentiments. Adults might understand the book. However, in the end, how powerful is a book? I feel as though speeches, actions, and evidence you can see with your own eyes (wildfires in California, snow storms in Central America, horrible droughts, hurricanes all over the world, etc) are more powerful than a book. 
           <br><Br>

However, the people behind the book are a threat. I don't see how any group of people could deny climate change unless they were not educated well on the subject. Therefore, I could just say that the conservatives and fossil fuel companies are ignorant. However, it's hard to be ignorant in today's world, when your daily life is flooded with information via the internet and social media. People are well aware of the climate crisis. Therefore, I must blame it on selfishness. These people are simply putting aside the common good in order to advance their own personal agendas. Before the climate crisis, I feel as though this is the problem we should tackle -- because it is a big obstacle.

<br><hr>

I agree with your idea. Some people would find any kind of method to benefits themselves and now young students, which means children are their target. Children are not yet gain the ability to view a new opinion that they have newly accepted comprehensively. The most treacherous point is that this book targets teachers as well, and teachers are trustworthy to students, which means that once students have been told by their teachers that global warming is not concerning, they will surely believe this information as truth. 
           <br><Br>
This situation makes me feel disgusting as well. The pollutive companies funded books that can poison people’s mind. What’s more, I hold negative view on this matter. In order to make more money, fossil fuel companies will fund as much book as possible, which means that more minds will be poisoned. Now 40 percent of audience suspected the reliability of the book. However, in the future, audience that can view this matter clearly will be less that current number, while more mind poisoning book will be printed. This situation must be handled with most hast.

After watching and reading the article I am blown away by the amount of information that is misleading. The whole article was aimed at making me believe that climate change is not real and that it is not man caused. They brought in other sources and sited them which made it sound realistic. But this source shows the sad reality of why so many people are uninformed and it is due to false information being the only information that people see and learn. 

           <br><Br>

The biggest shock to me was that schools are being targeted as a resulted being misled. Knowing that heartland institute sent out over 30,000 copies to teachers of this book is just sickening. This book is so convincing that many teachers who have bad information are teaching this to the future generations. For example in Montana a new law was passed saying that CO2 has no impact on global warming. This is all due to Liberal think tanks and money.

I'm going to be honest, at first, I was not really interested in the book and skimmed the introduction but after reading chapters 1-3 thoroughly, I almost switched sides. I agree that they pulled out receipts and facts about multiple falsely credited articles, journals, etc. which is the reason why I was so convinced. I liked how the book was easy to read and comprehend and the overall organizational structure of it as well. The authors had a very assuring tone throughout the book and that helped with the mood of the book. It did not come off as too cocky or "I'm right, they're wrong" attitude. However, I do think that the authors were very nitpicky with the articles they chose to analyze. There were very small things that they pointed out which felt as if they were reaching. Overall, I liked the book because it is educational about multiple subjects and the IPPC but at the same time, I felt that the book was a bit biased too. 

           <br><Br>

Regarding Ken's video, I was shocked to learn that K-12 educators had to say certain things about climate change to the future of this society. I understand that they're required to say only facts but it leads to a misconception of climate change to students. The fact that they basically have to say - in simple terms - "humans did not cause climate change, it's due to nature" is so frustrating for me to wrap my head around. The generation who needs to protect the planet the most or there will not be a place for them to live in the future is incredibly ignorant to me. I just hope that their parents educate them and help fight the climate crisis because it's truly sad for this propaganda to take place. I wonder why truly why the government or at least some parts of it are so negligible towards climate change enough to manipulate other people to disregard the massive issue too. Ken additionally speaks about how the Heartland Institute is fueled by those who own fossil fuel companies. I hadn't realized that many organizations and companies were bribed and corrupt. It is such a slap in the face to the public and their trust in those companies.

This book was extremely difficult to get through. Frankly, it was boring, and dry, but I was a bit confused when parts of it made sense. I’m very glad Ken is showing us the opposite side (even when he knows it's completely wrong) because I can tell that Ken really cares about climate change, and presenting us with the other side only makes Ken’s argument stronger because he rebuttals this awful book. I consider myself to be open minded, but it was scary thinking this book tried to convince me that my strong beliefs were false, so I admit it was well written with many rhetorical devices which make this entire hoax it seem true. 
           <br><Br>

The entire book claims NASA is misleading, scientific journals lie about the 97% because they are not peer-reviewed, they’re written by students, they use abstracts which exaggerate findings, and they survey scientists who aren’t experts in every single field possible. The authors add many citations which make you go, hey, they did their research! Every line tries to make climate scientists and activists look stupid, and of course blame liberals for everything. It isn’t crazy to say climate change is interdisciplinary, but when you go on to list almost every field possible and then call scientist liars because they only have one or two specialities, well that’s just absurd. You don’t need to be an expert to know climate change is real. They also blame the topic for being political, which yea it shouldn’t be. Yet, the book goes on to claim that climate change reports were funded by “liberal foundations with little or no scientific expertise.” The authors themselves are conservatives funded by fossil fuels industries, and yet they say ‘don’t trust the government!’ They make no sense. 
           <br><Br>
Reading the amazon reviews of this book just made me sad. The top positive review basically slams scientists and calls them liars, but then praises the authors for being scientists! Scientists Disagree About Global Warming is trying to brainwash students across the country, and is helping create a cycle of ignorance.

I have to completely agree with pretty much everything you stated, especially with appreciating the fact that Ken is showing us other people's views, being the exact opposite of what the course is teaching, and their reasons behind their beliefs. Being able to compare this book with everything we have learned the past two weeks, along with everything we have yet been taught by Ken, just makes me realize the truth behind Ken's argument, making it stronger than it already is as you mentioned. Coinciding with the idea your statement that this book is really trying to convince and prove to us that our beliefs, and learned facts, are false, it is horrific that people are taking advantage of children's lack of knowledge on the climate crisis to convince them that anthropogenic climate change is not real. Like you said, this is sadly leading to a cycle of ignorance. There are grown adults in the comments, who I am sure have witnessed this disaster that the climate crisis has brought and have been exposed to all of the evidence behind its causes, that still do not believe any of the legitimate facts right in front of their faces, so just imagine how easy it is to "hypnotize" children who have not understood or lived through the disasters that anthropogenic climate change is not real.

<br><hr>


It is very sad that they are trying to brainwash children, who will then go on to believe this even in adulthood. Children are the easiest to influence, and of course they will believe what their teachers tell them, so its even more disappointing that some K-12 teachers are easily manipulated and then go on to teach kids that climate change isn't real. You'd think grown adults wouldn't be so easily fooled.

I heard about global warming since I was a child, especially after taking this course I am more convinced that climate change is truly a serious man-made issue. However, after reading the first three chapters of the book " Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," my belief has been shaken. I am surprise that I doubted my year-long holding idea about climate crisis just after reading three chapters of a book, because I was holding an questioning mind before reading. Turns out I am partly persuaded by the author. No wonder why so many people suspect the reality about climate change, since there are so many contradictions among experts. This can explain why less than half of the middle or high school teachers choose 81%-100% of scientists agree on climate change.
           <br><Br>


I am anxious because while the doomsday will soon come upon the Earth, some are trying to misleading the public. For example, some companies fund the article of skeptics' so they can continue making more profits without being condemning by the society. It is shameful that some people spend tons of money and time to do such things, and it is also a pity that they do not devote all these resources on the urgent truth. For the huge topic like climate change requires the union of all human. Only if we work together and toward the same goal firmly, our future can be saved.

 Like you, I couldn’t help but start reading the first three chapters of “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” as factual work. I think what draws our mind into believing what the content of this reading to be true is that for so long we are taught “how to read” and to understand what credible sources are meant to look like. This book cites work, studies and names people as if knowledgable on this issue even though they’re not. It was especially difficult for me to see this book with a sole perspective when they tie in so many politics into the issue of climate change. It seems the author and of-course their publisher worked very hard to have its reader against the belief of climate change regardless of what political claim they could have to relate to its audience. I can especially recall the claim of ISIS and “Obama’s followers” a quite unrelated topic being used for the “author” and reader to have something in common.
           <br><Br>


I’m confused by your comment, “No wonder why so many people suspect the reality about climate change, since there are so many contradictions among experts”. The reality as we hear Ken and all other scientists knowledgable on this issue is that there is a 97% “agreement from actual experts that this is an issue. I’m assuming what you meant is that these statements are harder to teach when there seems to be a rise in books like the reading which tell you otherwise. I can’t imagine the confusion let alone sense of responsibility teachers and others in power must feel when they themselves are unsure about a subject but pressured into teaching or ignoring it. It’s especially frustrating when I read about the fact that even younger generations are the ones who’s perspective will be affected as they are the target of groups like
           <br><Br>
the Heartland Institute . We definitely have to start focusing on our sources and why the content of what we read holds an agenda depending on who is relaying information.

After reading this article, I was left frustrated. It was honestly a very hard read because I strongly believe in climate change and the fact that it is caused by human actions. I was even more convinced on climate change being real from the articles, documentaries, and lectures we were assigned to do in previous weeks. This article surprised me because it was trying to convince us that climate change is not real. This countered our previous assignments that have been convincing us that climate change is real. I was in shock that fossil fuel companies are paying educated people to ignore scientific facts. The companies are mainly targeting k-12 teachers which makes me so extremely frustrated. It makes sense that these teachers are targeted because they will be teaching children these facts. This in turn is going to make our future generations suffer and climate change will affect them the most. These children will start believing this false information and buy into the lies. I was also appalled to find out that children were not taught much about climate change in school. Looking back, I do not remember learning that much about the issues of climate change in school myself. My teachers would often touch on the subject and talk about the greenhouse gases/basics but they never went in depth with the issues that were taking place. This is something that needs to change immediately. Children need to be aware of these issues because they are going to be the ones suffering the most from the disasters soon to come. Instead they are being taught false information from teachers because of articles like these. The issue of climate change is being shifted from a scientific issue to a political one by this article. This is honestly a ridiculous idea because climate change is shown to be true from scientific findings, and you cannot outsmart or deny science. I think Ken is doing a great job in showing us these articles and videos. We are only in week 3 and I feel like I have become so much more educated on these topics. Other people could easily become more educated on these topics as well if they took the time to learn about it.

I agree, the most frustrating part of this for me was learning how conservative think tanks are using their power to spread false information to a vulnerable population-young students. Most of the information I have learned about climate change has come from formal education, this class for example and other classes I have taken. But up until college, climate change was not discussed in my experience. We have the opportunity as a society to educate this generation about the dangers of climate change, and the steps we need to take to alleviate the crisis. But if teachers are being given conservative propaganda that spreads “fake news”, for lack of a better term, then how can this be the generation that stops climate change? Change starts with the youth, and it is imperative that children are educated on the climate crisis from a scientific perspective, not a political one. Understanding where information comes from is always important, as it gives you an idea of what the goals of the author are. Is it to educate, or to persuade? Is it for scientific gain or for political gain? I appreciate the chance to look at the argument from the other side, but I do not believe that their arguments are justified, and clearly they have ulterior motivations.
<br><hr>
I also found myself very frustrated by this reading; not only did it strongly oppose the science of climate change, but there were statements of obvious hypocrisy. The book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” made many claims about the lack of reliability of scientific “consensus” regarding climate change, and that reports of anthropogenic climate change should not be trusted. One of the most frustrating things I read within the first few chapters of the book was the accusation of environmental leaders supporting the Clean Power Plan “because it will give them more power, more control, and more profit.” I find this to be insanely hypocritical, as many politicians in denial of climate change rest much of their power on the fossil fuel industry. The fossil fuel industry seems to have the politics of climate change on lockdown, with immense power given to those in favor of this industry and little room to pass environmentally friendly laws or regulations. Climate skeptics, like those in the NIPCC, have no right to attack environmentalists in their “attempts at power control,” as many climate deniers are doing the same.
           <br><Br>

Additionally, I strongly agree with your frustration regarding the politically fueled education system for K-12. Not only will these children not have enough education on the climate crisis, but they will grow up in disbelief of anthropogenic climate change. The Heartland Institute sending out 300,00 copies of their book to teachers is an example of the power of money in the climate crisis on a foundational level; the teachers, and therefore their students, may not know any better than to believe the information given to them, causing a downward spiral into the depths of disbelief for generations to come. Like you said, the education of global climate change is extremely important, at a foundational level and beyond. Although I had prior knowledge of climate change before this class from my high school Environmental Science class, it was my choice to take that class, and many of my friends made the choice not to. After seeing the amount of information I was taught in just one year of this public high school class, I believe that a basic level of understanding the environment and its anthropogenic impacts should be mandatory at some point of K-12 learning.

<br><hr>
My feeling during this read was also frustration. I felt like the author was writing for an audience not educated in the science and the reality of the climate crisis: the reading had a per-designated audience (climate change deniers), and I felt like each argument presented was hollow and easily refutable. However, it helps me to read things like this because it prepares me and makes me aware of what the other side is believing and why they don't "believe" our side. Additionally, I agree that it is no coincidence that K-12 grade is being targeted especially with the rise of young people rallying and going on strikes concerning the climate crisis. I feel like the push to keep k-12 grade children in the dark about this issue has worked for a while (ie, my generation growing up), but the newer generation seems to only feed off of the efforts which is inspiring to witness.

Through the three chapters I read from the novel, I honestly started to doubt if climate change was anthropogenically caused. This novel was written with such specific attacks on the idea of climate change that I took a double-take about the issue. The authors were discrediting many of the scientists who have commented on climate change and stating that their information came from “gray-sources.” This may be true for some of the information as some scientists are corrupted by the money of attributing to climate change; but, we don’t know for a fact if this information is biasedly placed there. The entire article was negative and back-slashing and the information chosen to write about was carefully articulated to steer readers into the direction that climate change is not real. Everything written in this article about how scientists who believe in climate change are part of political interference and contain gray-sources can be stated about the information in this article opposing climate change. There were no persuasive ideas of why we should consider climate change to be a hoax. The authors were very focused on the information about the 97% consensus of climate change: even if 97% of scientists do not agree with climate change and it is only, for example, 95% of scientists, we should still be taking action. It is apparent that the weather is changing and our minds of whether this is real might be pulled in either direction, but it doesn't hurt to try and fix the problem. We should all try and see what the problem is by changing our ways of overuse of fossil fuels and understand that we have changed the weather in one way or another.

I, too, started to doubt if climate change was anthropogenically caused. While reading this article, I was taken aback because I was very surprised by how legitimate everything sounded. For most of my life, I have been confused by how many people do not believe that humans are causing climate change to happen at an alarming rate. However, after reading these chapters, I can understand why many people are convinced that climate change is not real. This may have been due to the fact that I have never fact-checked these scientists, like how these chapters seemed to do. The fact that many scientists may be power-hungry, biased people seemed to have never crossed my mind. In addition, I never thought about the fact that climate change is not a huge deal when it comes to K-12 education. We should be teaching the future of this nation how to live sustainably!  I agree that this article had a huge focus on the fact that there “is not a consensus when it comes to climate change.” However, even if it is not exactly 97%, there are more scientists that believe that climate change is happening due to anthropogenic reasons, and we must do something about it. This book made me become more skeptical whenever I read anything about climate change.

When I was reading the “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, I noticed that there are a lot of contradictions and diverse views about global warming and climate change. Many scientists have different interpretations of their beliefs on climate change. It is interesting how scientists all have their own outlook on climate change. Some scientists are biased about climate change since they don’t have enough information or inaccurate information and others want to make significant changes and believe in climate change. There are many different beliefs when we elaborate on climate change. It was interesting how scientists have their own perspective with this statement, “Ninety-seven percent of the world’s scientists tell us this is urgent,” he added (Kerry, 2014). Three days earlier, President Obama tweeted that “Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: #climate change is real, man-made and dangerous” (Obama, 2014). This statement is frightening to hear how we the people are causing climate change which will evolve for more threatening events to occur. This encourages me to look through my daily actions and schedule to make sure that I am making a positive impact in my community and to my world. In addition, it scary that the book informs how the, “(95%+ certainty) that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together…”This emphasizes the dramatic increase of the greenhouse gas concentrations to the atmosphere and increasing very rapidly. In the reading, it also informs how we need to regulate the climate change by reducing the greenhouse gas by stating, “Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks” We need to make impactful decisions and to make sure that we are decreasing the amount of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. It was devastating to me how the majority believes that man-made global warming can cause a negative impact, but this will come to realization that we need to act fast before it is too late. When the author emphasizes about his voting, the author distinguishes how the vast majority believes in global warming by stating, “it appears 76 percent of those who believe in man-made global warming also believe it is “very harmful” or “somewhat harmful,” so it appears 39.5 percent of AMS members responding to the survey say they believe man-made global warming could be dangerous.

I agree with your point on the contradictions the authors made throughout the reading. For example, they talked about “peer reviews” and how IPCC didn’t use enough of those but went on to say how peer reviews were actually bad. As a reader, I’m even more confused with NIPCC’s agenda. I understand that scientists have different outlooks on climate change, but I believe these different views are essential pieces that are needed to be put together in order to look at the bigger picture. Confirmation bias was repeatedly mentioned in the book, but this phrase should not be used lightly if you couldn’t provide any hard evidence. I feel like many times the book pointed out what’s wrong with IPCC, but it didn’t provide the correct correspondences to their claims. I’m not sure if you understood the book’s position on climate change and global warming. They are using these facts to prove that it’s flawed. They aren’t using them to show you how surprising the statistics are. But honestly, I feel like I rather have readers like you then readers that understand what they are reading and believe in it. So, I’m glad you caught on the facts and kept up with them. I will still give you a breakdown of what they really want you to get out of it. These authors are utilizing economic crisis, popular skepticism, and common sense as their grounds against alarmists. But these shouldn’t be used as reasons to convince people because these are factors that cause fear and not informative to the general public of the issue that’s going on here. Their focus is on concerned citizens and taxpayers that are still in the middle of the situation. They hope to sway them into believing that climate change is a hoax, but it certainly is not! When they mentioned that we should focus more on people who are suffering the consequences of sub-prime financial instruments, I almost started thinking wait a minute they do have a point because it reminded me of the film Before the Flood when DiCaprio met with the lady from India and how she mentioned their challenge isn’t climate change, it’s basic human living. But I do believe that the author wasn’t making the same connection here, but I also fell for that. In addition, they kept bringing up that climate models have failed to predict the flattening of the global temperature curve. However, I hope they realize they models are meant to be used a reference tool. You should never solely rely on models alone to make predictions about the future.

I also noticed the same idea as the comment above while reading, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” in which there are many differing and conflicting views about global warming and climate change amongst people in the world including scientists. This is normal with any commonly debated about topic in today’s society. After the knowledge I have acquired so far, going into this article I was pretty set on the fact that human activity is the main cause of climate change so I was interested in reading this article to see if it was going to change my mind in any way. Although the article made some good points and seemed convincing in some areas, I was still not fully convinced and be sure about changing my mind to the side of those who disagree and think climate change is happening naturally and not by human activity. It seemed as though these scientists who disagree were making claims that did not have sufficient and provable evidence and seemed as though their thoughts were just circling. What I found quite alarming was the fact that then Heartland Institute mailed out free copies of this book to K-12 teachers in the United States to give and read about to their students. This is extremely scary to me because how could they be letting these children fall into the trap of believing that climate change is not a problem of theirs. These upcoming and future generations are going to be the ones who well help climate change and some of the few that are left who can make an actual impact. Losing several children to this book can be a harmful thing to our society if not acted upon.

This is the first time I hear the idea of scientists disagree about global warming. I don’t think I agree this idea. I guess probably there are a small percentage of scientists that disagree about global warming, but definitely not all of them. We can see several facts happening on our Earth. The melting ice in the pole area, the hole in the ozone sphere, and the extinction of some species, these are not made-up or imagination or hypothesis. These are not exaggerations. I believe at least no Chinese scientists disagree about global warming.
<br><br>
My another popping thought is how easily deceived the public is. Seriously, when there are more and more drought and flood, will people still say that there are no climate change? I thought something like ‘climate change is real,’ ‘there is global warming,’ ‘protect the Earth’ have all become consensus because it’s already 2020. Why when minority has objection, there are a lot of people starting to rethink?

I agree with your comment. I think it is crazy that people are denying a crisis so present and so real just because it is easier to ignore the issue. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that climate change is in fact real and is a situation that needs to be addressed and solved as soon as possible. The extreme weather and disasters that have been continuously occurring throughout the world in recent years should be evidence enough. I think it is also very interesting that these people felt the need to send 300,000 free books directed to the youngest generation. It is a clear showing that they not only want to push this idea on others, but influence the children which could create disastrous effects if these young minds are misled at their young age. I think it is a scary thought that people could be believing their claims, and I hope that the world can see through these backwards beliefs.

I just realized a question that someone asked me when he and I were discussing about pollutions: are these severe natural disasters: typhoon, tornado, and tsunami, caused by human polluting the Earth? I answered him ‘no.’ Then, he asked me, ‘why should people stop polluting the Earth if it will not cause these severe natural disasters?’ Well, (not) because it will cause other severe disasters that you didn’t mention…

I should probably start off by saying that this reading didn’t move me one bit. It could possibly be due to the fact that I wouldn’t want to believe nonsense, and basically disprove everything that I’ve believed up to this point about climate change. It could probably be due to the fact that I’m probably just bias, or I just feel like the arguments weren’t as persuasive enough. I was surprised to read that there are quite a few scientists that don’t believe in climate change. It seemed as it was about half and half, which is why no one had come to a consensus, which I find quite hard to believe. It gets me thinking whether or not maybe the climate deniers flawed their evidence. It is said in the reading that climate is a disciplinary subject which I agree is true, but there are certainly some subjects that are more related and consists more about the climate than others. For example, sure there are some aspects of economics on the subject of climate, but what does have a greater role and understanding of the climate are subject matters such as geochemistry. 
<br><br>
Though the climate deniers do make some points about the validity of certain observational evidence and uncertainty, I believe it can go both ways. Climate “alarmists” can disprove climate deniers. For example, it is said in the reading that deniers say that, “...increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.” That is completely BS. If this was true, plants and animals wouldn’t be going extinct at such an alarming rate. Therefore, it can be said the other way around that their data can be flawed as well. Some of their claims lack validity; for example, it was claimed that, “The parallelism of temperature and CO2 increases between about 1980 and 2000AD could be due to chance and does not necessarily indicate causation.” By “chance”, really? That’s the best they can come up with? They have to make more valid claims than that. Another claim I find extremely hard to believe was by the NIPCC, which claimed that “No close correlation exists between temperature variation over the past 150 years and human-related CO2 emissions.” This is clearly false, considering that fact that evidence disproves this, but then again it seems like both sides seem to lack validity.

As a climate activist and firm believer that climate change has devestating effects and is caused by anthropogenic causes, I agree with you that these climate deniers and their statements are unruly. However, I do think it is still important to consider their claims partially. Like I said, I definitely lean more left; however, I do not think it is very beneficial to negate everything that the other side has to say. The left can too be overly-dramatic and have biases. I believe that we must be aware of all biases when the difference of views present themselves. If the article did not move you at all, I do not think you were reading it close enough. It definitely was persuassive and I think it highlighted ways in which science can be construed to follow one’s preassumptions and biases. If anything, that is all the article did for me. I still believe in everything that I did (relating to the climate crisis) prior to reading “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”. However, it served to remind me how both sides are trying their utmost best to influence the public in what they want them to believe, whether they may be right or wrong.

I thought people had already reached a consensus that climate crisis is here and it is urgent to at least to be slowed down under all human beings' effort. However, the book shocked me with a totally opposite point. What shocked me more is every point raised in the book was fully supported by all kinds of evidence and data, and you can hardly find any logical flaw in that. Thinking about that the book was printed and sent to elementary schools all over the States and that teacher who can hardly make judgement on that will repeat what the books talk about to the kinds further shocked me. Our next generation might grow up and think there is no climate change at all and everything in our lives are not needed for change. Our earth will speed up perishing if that day really come.

Ken mentioned how crucial education is in the conversation about anthropogenic climate change and in general the climate crisis. I stand behind this point 100% because I have seen with many different topics and issues that what students are taught at school and at home crucially affects their own way of thinking and ideologies. When Ken mentioned that 300,000 copies of the book were sent to teachers around the country I wasn’t even shocked, just frustrated with their evil and manipulative behaviors. Teachers nationwide are basically being brainwashed to believe that climate change isn’t caused by humans by large corporations that support digging up fossil fuels for profit. The book, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” was very interesting to read because of how believable it sounded. Many readers aren’t going to look into all of the statistics and “flawed” studies that the book explains so they would automatically believe what the authors of the book are saying. This is dangerous for our planet in the short and long term because the more fossil fuels we dig up and the less we see our own impact on the Earth, the worse our situation will be. Young kids should be taught the truth about the climate crisis and the information presented to them should not be biased under any circumstances because teaching them about climate change not being caused by humans will continue the vicious cycle of digging more fossil fuels that is happening today.

<br><br>

In many states that are usually more conservative, teachers explain to their students that there are two sides to the climate change issue and that many scientists don’t believe in anthropogenic climate change. These teachers are making the climate crisis a political and geographical based issue which is incorrect and needs to end. Everyone will be affected by the consequences of climate change, whether you are a Republican or Democrat, whether you live in California or Alabama. While I was reading the first 3 chapters of the book, I felt that what they presented to me sounded right and believable, and if I didn’t have information about the truth regarding climate change, I might have believed it.

I don't doubt the credibility of some of the findings in the book, however, I do believe a majority of the data was cherry-picked to fulfill a certain agenda; sadly, there are a number of books and studies that interpret data in a set specific way. This book focused on "illuminating" the curtain over the climate skepticists and why there are publicly so few. It did not, however, reveal any damning evidence against climate change. It was a politically motivated book from the start and with political motivation comes biases. 
<br><br>

Let's pretend for a minute that anthropogenic climate change is minimal at best. Even if humans are not causing climate change, there is still a responsibility as an advanced species to protect or fight against the change. We are realistically the only inhabitants on this planet that have any effect on it, so it our duty to fight against anything that is inhibiting the quality of life on this planet; for our species as well as other species' sake. It is hard to see the side of the argument that climate change by itself is not an issue, there seems to be overwhelming evidence alluding to disastrous effects resulting from a few degrees of temperature change. We need to fight this problem regardless of what side you are on.

As I read other comments, I was surprised at how others were almost convinced by the Heartland Institute. I read it knowing that this text was written to completely go against climate change because of the political agenda. I agree with how you mentions the "cherry picking" because the writers are obviously trying to find any reason to oppose the fact that climate change is real. I found the first chapter of the book to be useless and redundant information. In my opinion it does not matter whether there is consensus or not in the scientific community at this point. We are so far into the crisis that the debate over whether scientists agree or not is useless. I think the division between scientists is obvious enough that there doesn't have to be a whole chapter about it written by the Heartland Institute. Point is that the climate change deniers are wrong and they should really put politics aside and accept that the crisis is happening now. Overall, the text was redundant to me only because I read it knowing it was all bad. 
<br><br>
Now if a teacher, student, or child were to read this, I would be sad. I think the Heartland Institute’s method is smart. They obviously know who to target. Although it is smart, it is so wrong. They are trying to create a generation of climate change deniers as it would do anything but become a greater politcal problem. 
<br><br>
I think it relates to your last sentence. It doesnt matter whether they create a genration of deniers. Both the deniers and the believers will be suffering. We already are.

Like any topic, it’s very important to understand both sides of the argument. You can’t be blinded by one side of the argument and completely ignore the other side. For that reason, this book was important for us to read, even if it was most likely published or financed by a conservative think-tank funded by the fossil fuel industry. We’ve already been educated a good amount with facts supporting anthropogenic climate change, so I don’t believe this one book will completely change one’s perspective. 
<br><br>

However, this book did make some very logical and persuasive points that were very tempting to believe. For example, the authors stated, “Climate is an interdisciplinary subject requiring insights from many fields. Very few scholars have mastery of more than one or two of these disciplines.” This is a very valid argument that is hard to refute. It’s statements like these that tended to shift my perspective slightly; however, it’s important to look at the big picture of climate change. There’s scientific data proving that anthropogenic climate change exists. Even if 97% of scientists have not reached a consensus, it does not mean that we should not begin taking action to mitigate the future effects of climate change.

While watching this lecture I learned that the book we previewed the first 3 chapters for was freely distributed to 300,000 teachers as a way to convince the American children the climate change isn't real. Just typing that fact is socking to me that this tactic was used as a way to convince millions that climate change isn't real just because of prestigious, overbearing fossil fuel companies. Learning more about these institutes made me a little sick realizing that children are being preached dangerously false information as a way to preserve fossil fuel companies  through the uneducated minds of their teachers. Hearing that 50% of K-12 teachers do not teach about climate change was shocking as I believed it was becoming a more relevant topic due to the increase in catastrophes. Hearing the bills passed in some American states allowing the use of false climate change information was extremely shocking as I did not realize nor understand the extent of the hatred some Americans have for climate change and the extent they would go through to disprove it. 
<br><br>

As I was reading the book I noticed one significant fact and it was the one thing I could really only think of. They talked of the warming being of natural causes and not of human activity but yet there was not a lot of evidence to prove that statement whereas data for human activity is growing significantly. While I noticed that fact, I was still able to see how this book could be convincing to those uneducated on the topic of global warming and climate change. It still makes me sad that there is no regulated idea to teach to all children about climate change because while some may get extremely beneficial and scientifically true information the majority get negation, false, biased based  information about climate change. While I could see how this book could be convincing I stay true with my belief that the climate change is real and due to human activity and fossil fuel emission. I believe that K-12 teachers should be given a regulated idea to teach to their children because at this rate climate change will never change if children are receiving fossil fuel company propaganda about how climate change isn't real. Publishing their book for the everyday public makes it easy for your average day person to come across and read about something they have no prior education leading to the possibility of falling prey to the false preachings of these companies.

I agree with you and find it important that you assessed both sides of this argument and then still came to your own conclusion. I too tried to make the best possible case for the view that countered my own that way I would avoid letting my bias get in the way of reading this literature. It is written like a skilled persuasive essay in my opinion. However, the loaded language used to bash highly respected scientists and even Nobel prize winners lead me to believe this book was written in an attempt to disprove the science while all it found was ways to instill false doubt in an uneducated public. I also still believe that climate change is anthropogenic. I also feel like the heartland institute did everything it could to make researchers look bias and funded by the government to find specific conclusions while ignoring the fact that heartland itself is funded by fossil fuel companies and business moguls like the Koch brothers . This book is propaganda for skepticism. Hypocrisy is written all over this. The writers criticize the research methods rather than attempting to run their own experiments to fix the problems within the research that they discussed. They don't want the research to be fixed because then the outcome will still show that climate change is anthropogenic. They actually want to hit on these mistakes and use them as fuel for skepticism. They have no intention of finding out the truth.They say that we cannot understand climate change because we only look at it from the perspective of earth scientists.  If these writers and scientists really wanted to persuade me to believe in natural climate change, I would want to see an interdisciplinary research article with all of the fields mentioned in the book working together to find an answer that was not funded by either side of this argument. 
<br><br>

In regards to your ideas about educating our K-12 teachers and students, I agree that a plan should be made to allow children to get the facts. Even if teaching anthropogenic climate change is regulated in public schools, there should at least be a bipartisan framework in place so students can learn about each side of this issue. I rather them be educated on both views, even if one view is wrong, than to never receive proper education on this pressing issue.

After reading the first three chapters of this article, I was surprised at the information the writers were able to pull out. Although I come from the biased point of view of believing in climate change, I am always responsive and accepting of counterarguments. I thought it was a very interesting read since most of what we have done in this class is basically proving that the climate crisis is real and that we need to act on it. I realized that this article, although trying to preface that climate change isn’t real, rather focused on that there isn’t enough evidence to support that the climate crisis is real and that it’s happening right now. The article tries to prove that the main reason the climate is changing is natural and not primarily because of human activity. If I was just skimming through the article I probably would have been more convinced, but during my thorough reading I noticed that the writers were basically just trying to find loopholes in the statistics of people who believe in climate change. They try and portray climate change believers to be lying and providing inaccurate data. Even though I may have a biased view, noticing the climate change rejectors basing their argument off of information through small loopholes they found made me lose a little bit of respect for the people trying to spread this fake news. I really hope that the truth about how disastrous (and real) this climate crisis is and how we all need to act immediately.

I believe I had a similar experience with the reading as you did. Actually paying attention and comprehending what was being written in this article, it really is a lot of nonsense. It is easy to pull out facts and statistics to support your argument, especially on a topic like this. The topic of climate change is especially easy to do this with because it is really impossible to know with 100% certainty what exactly is happening and what will happen in the future. If articles like these, sponsored by fossil fuel industries, can get you to doubt anthropogenic climate change for even a second, their job is done as their money keeps piling in. Any time you try and prove something, there will be certain aspects left out on purpose, and this article is a perfect example of that. As you step away from this article and realize who funded it, you realize that most of it can not really be taken seriously, as these fossil fuel companies are trying to stall to keep their profits coming. You could tell by the Amazon reviews that people reading this already have preconceived notions about climate change, and that this article wasn't going to change that. It was either "this is great" or "this is disastrous". I feel like the lack of a middle ground is troubling in this argument.


<br><hr>
thank you for commenting! I definitely agree that the lack of a middle ground is troubling, especially when the facts seem so one-sided and there is actual proof of the effects of climate change. Also, I feel that we have a more knowledgeable view of this topic because we are literally taking a class that focuses on proving that climate change is true,  its horrible effects, and what we can/should do to stop the climate crisis. In addition, we have watched multiple documentaries and lectures that describe the disasters that happened because of the climate change, and seeing something like this that tries to reject climate change seems like a large bit of ignorance. Also, since we have both experienced something related to the fires, it can be easier for us to reject the climate change deniers, and I really hope that we can all convince the rest of the world that climate change is real and that it is happening right now.
<br><hr>

Our personal experiences definitely help us realize what is truly happening because we have seen the effects of climate change with our own eyes. However, if there is one thing we have learned throughout this course it is that climate change does not just affect one group, it affects all of us. I think what Ken is doing with this reading is perfect: it gives us an idea of what the other side is thinking. By getting a glimpse from their point of view, we can learn about why they are still denying the climate crisis (HINT: it's all about money). By making the material of this class open to the public, Ken is allowing the world to see the hypocrisy of the climate change denier's arguments, which hopefully should help the word spread.

I found it very concerning that such a book exists despite the very obvious toll climate change is already taking on the world. As I read the first three chapters of this book, it just sounded like someone in denial. It was consistently just the author taking any argument that supported global warming and finding ways to refute it. Another thing this book constantly tried to demonstrate was how there was no consensus. They had survey results in the book that showed scientists answering different answers and used this as proof that scientists did not agree with one another about climate change, and that the notion that 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real was false. I was pretty frustrated as I read this book, and found many of the arguments repetitive and illogical. It doesn’t take much hard scientific evidence to see the effect climate change is having on the earth, and how much we contribute to it.
 <br><br>
Another point that was brought up in one of the comments on Amazon and in Ken’s lecture was who was funding the distribution of this book, the Heartland Institute. The fact that they were targeting teachers by sending this book to them horrified me. It reminded me of how advertisements would often target kids to try to sell their products. Kids are easily influenced into believing in the wrong things, and are also very influential in a number of ways. I found it disgusting that the fossil fuel industry would go so far to secure their own wellbeing. They are denying the truth so that they can make more money, and I find this very selfish and revolting. This is an issue that very much involves them, too. We all live on this earth and I cannot believe that they are valuing the profits they could make off fossil fuels over the wellbeing of our planet.

I too found it rather frustrating reading the first three chapters try hard to deny the scientific consensus that climate change is real and is caused by humans when I know that all the scientific proof is right there that shows how wrong they are. I agree with your statement that their argument was repetitive, for the author to devote three whole chapters to just reject the fact that there is a scientific consensus makes me wonder if their other arguments denying the existence of climate change is any less repetitive. However, I can see an instance where someone with little to no knowledge on the proven facts that climate change is indeed very real, and that 97% of scientists actually do agree about it, could be manipulated into believing their argument. And it’s pretty scary that they can just spread misinformation like that, knowing that someone without the correct information about the climate crisis will fall for it.
   <br><br>
 I am especially disgusted with the fact that the Heartland Inst. would target impressionable students by manipulating the minds of their teachers with misinformation. As someone who plans to pursue a career in K-12 education, I (and I am sure everyone) know how dangerous it is to teach students the wrong information or avoid teaching them the subject at all. We can see those effects in regard to sex education and in history classes by leaving out important lessons.  To encourage educators to teach these students, the generation that will (and already are) feeling the most drastic consequences of the climate crisis, misinformation about climate change and human impact on it is evil. Older generations have already done a great disservice to young students by putting them in this climate crisis situation in the first place, and now they digging the knife deeper in by not providing them with the information they will need to combat it.

After reading the first few chapters of this book, I learned that climate is a very profound subject, which involves many fields, from which the opinions of scientists involved in different fields are different. It may be because of prejudice, interest or politics that it is difficult for scientists to reach consensus. And produced a lot of false news and some books, so as to crack down on people's beliefs and make people have doubts. This book contains a lot of well-documented arguments and persuasive views, almost refuting the view that "prove" human beings are responsible for climate disasters. What is even more disturbing is that they have made the books available online and sent them to schools free of charge, thus accelerating the spread of their influence. Let those people misunderstand climate change. This makes us readers have a certain impact, let alone those children who are not fully educated, which often has a significant impact on their lives.

The notion that there is no scientific consensus on climate change presented in the reading doesn’t sound convincing to me. Sure, they do present evidence supporting this argument, however, they describe that there is no null hypothesis presented anywhere in any of the scientific research the supports climate change. This makes me question the validity of the whole reading because they themselves do not present a null either, at least from what I understood. The climate change supporters are described as not producing what the research field coins as “good science” which is being able to be unbiased with your research and not knit picking evidence that will produce an outcome you want. But if that’s the case, then the authors in this case are not presenting “good science” either. 
   <br><br>

It makes sense that there is a such thing as biased science. In the reading, the quote stood out to me the most: “Hulme calls climate change ‘a classic example of ... ‘post-normal science,’which he defines (quoting Silvio Funtowicz and Jerry Ravetz) as “the application of science to public issues where ‘facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent’” (Idso, Carter, Singer). But the authors of the NIPCC Report are doing the same thing. They are hand picking the technical flaws of IPCC and presenting slippery slope arguments from that evidence to appeal to the ignorant to seem credible. Based on this, it makes me question why skeptics and alarmists have two different definitions of human activity when it should be a clear cut definition. This is why I think teachers are confused on teaching climate change in our school systems. The subject of climate change has been subject to bias when it shouldn’t be. The political community has made it a “hear say” issue. Since there are both sides to this issue, teachers feel like their opinion matters more than presenting the hard scientific facts that are actually out there which manipulates the minds of the younger generation today.

I find it alarming how effective these conservative think tanks are being. I will admit while reading Why Scientist Disagree About Climate Change, I was questioning what I know. I don’t think I was questioning why climate change is real, but the surveys and the consensus. I will say that the reading made me not agree with how we collect and present information. The fact that surveyors pick and choose what information to present as evidence in order to sway public opinion is not right. I think just presenting the facts as they are is enough as long as it is coming from a reputable source and not people who are unqualified. Its angering because I believe in climate change and I rely on surveys to give me the stats of what actual, relevant scientists think about the issue, and the fact that the numbers are twisted makes the reliability of surveys come into question. I am disappointed because this is the disconnect and contemplation big fossil fuel corporations want. I don’t care if you make the numbers look better, or if scientist argue because they don’t have all the facts and have a little bias, give me the information we as humans know and let me decide for myself if climate change is real.
   <br><br>


I’d like to reiterate, I think climate change is real, and this piece only made me rethink my opinion on how we present our findings that have to do with climate change. Again, I think it is genius for skeptics to use the schools as a way to spread their skepticism. If I was younger and still grew up in a house where my parents kept talking about climate, I still may question climate change if my teachers kept preaching that the public is divided on the issue and their is no direct proof. It is a shame that scientists who believe in climate change don’t do the same. If we could advertise to a younger generation the possible world we are forging a path too, it will scare them to seek an alternative future. This is the same in politics, one side makes all the moves while the other passively watches, but in this case we as the so called “alarmist” can’t be the ones who observe a new generation that doesn’t think climate change is real.

I would also like to preface this with the fact that I do 100% believe in human driven climate change. While reading the book, I also questioned what I know about climate change and how accurate or skewed the information we receive could be. It also made me realize that it is important to consider all sides of arguments and try to look at data with as unbiased of a perspective as possible. The NIPPC claims the data taken from these studies is greatly skewed, which could very well be true. Even though they say this, I would like to look into these claims in more detail to see how accurate their evidence is. I completely agree that the data given should be true instead of trying to prove a point. 
   <br><br>

The NIPCC did a great job of pushing their agenda through this book. They clearly pointed out their evidence and sources with claims that made reasonable sense. They might not be true, but their way of presenting their idea was done well. It did make me questions some aspects of what scientists really think about anthropogenic climate change. I could see how this book being distributed to teachers and schools could have a large impact on kids growing up denying climate change, which is a frightening thought.
<br><hr>
I am also surprised that fossil fuel industries and conservative think tanks are able to get away with all of this. I too still completely believe in anthropogenic climate change and know that it is important, but the first three chapters of this book did a very good job at making me question my sources and facts. As Ken’s video explained, almost every climate-skeptic article/book we find will most likely be published or funded by the fossil fuel industry. We have to keep that in mind whenever reading anything that denies climate change. Because of the extent of greed that fossil fuel industries and conservative think tanks have, they will do and say anything that helps them get money. It is so disappointing to see that individuals and corporations are willing to go to such extremes, compromising the future of our planet, just for their own personal, short-lived lives. 
   <br><br>
What makes me the most sad is that the Heartland Institute sent out so many copies to school teachers across the country. A lot of kids may have parents who aren’t educated on the topic of climate change so the kids won’t know anything about it unless taught by their teachers at school. However, when these teachers are getting books like this one, it is likely they are teaching what they read. What gives me hope however, is that the parents and teachers who are educated on the topic are passing the information to their children and students which in turn do something about it and recognize it as an urgent issue. Our generation is doing a lot to spread the word about climate change. The youth climate strike across the entire planet has brought a lot of attention to global climate change from all generations. Greta Thunberg has been a loud voice in the movement, which is so encouraging and inspiring to young people to take action.  
   <br><br>
We also have to realize that books and articles like this one are literally designed to make us question what we know and where we get our information, and that is a good thing. It is good to be able to recognize when something, like the book published by the Heartland Institute, is biased. Knowing how you get your facts and everything behind it will help to make your argument stronger.
<br><hr>
I think you brought up a good point about how it pushes their agenda. Their whole argument in the book seemed very logical and that appeal is seen. The surprising part is that they can use there logical argument to get an angry, emotional response out of the audience that is on the fence or believes the climate crisis, while also swaying younger generations. They are basically using the research and surveys against us who fight and speak up about the climate crisis. It just shows how far a little misinformation can cause us to question all we know. It also shows how clear information needs to be presented in order to prevent bodies like the NIPCC from meddling and, like you said, skewing information. I am looking forward to seeing how we can combat this sort of misinformation.

<br><hr>

I completely agree with the last part of your comment in which you mentioned that "alarmists" can't be the ones who don't consider climate change real. To compare with, a teacher must know and understand all the knowledge they are teaching in order to make his or her students learn thoroughly and effectively. Therefore, for an alarmist, if he or she does not think of climate change as a serious global issue or even bias and lack of knowledge, it will become a more severe issue afterward. 

   <br><br>

Even though most of the scientists disagree about climate change, but my question and concern is "do they really understand what they are debating about or just looking at the unrealistic statistics and put forward to the readers?" In my opinion, this will soon become another issue in which we, our generation, are facing right now: plenty of information, evidence, and statistics that contain errors or bias. And these will only lead to misconceptions and misunderstandings between experts and people who are actually learning and obtaining.

<p>
First of all, I disagree with both the methodologies used by the Heartland institute and the IPCC. Both of these organizations have turned climate change from purely a scientific issue to a political one. I do believe in climate change and the climate crisis as a whole, and while I have no doubt that human actions are exacerbating such issues, Its still important to look at climate change from all angles. I do not agree with the IPCC defining climate change as merely "human caused climate change." 

   <br><br>

Although I do not agree with most of the Heartland institute's article, I will admit that the IPCC's definition of climate change already acts as a bias towards gathering and providing data that would support human caused climate change. As a matter of fact, this definition makes climate change a one dimensional issue when in fact it is a complex issue that required knowledge of countless fields. Because of this, I do believe that the IPCC has political bias and motive, therefore making their data a little less credible. On the same token, the Heartland institute has been known to target school children and get their political agenda out through questionable means. I think until we can look at climate change as a complex issue with many contributing factors, there won't be a clear scientific consensus. This raises this issue of the "precautionary principle". We need to take action before there is a scientific consensus. I think the IPCC painted the picture they wanted to about climate change under this precautionary principle to ensure that political action would be taken. I, and the environment , am grateful for this. However, I hope the climate change scientists will work with other scientific experts in diverse fields in order to get more accurate data.

you bring some very good points about the Climate Change debate. I also agree that the IPCC has both political bias and motive, which in certain cases can harm their credibility. Interesting take on the precautionary principle, I agree wholeheartedly.
<br><hr>

Interesting viewpoint. I definitely think the IPCC is biased as well, but this bias is probably a result of consistent scientific work and proof about global warming. The people of the IPCC, just like most educated people have followed the evidence and reached the conclusion anyone in ther right mind would. When 97% of scientists agree on climate change, then it's no surprise - and shouldn't even be a problem - that a board made of scientists investigating climate change would be biased towards that perspective.
   <br><br>

Although the arguments presented by the NIPC may seem reasonable on the surface,  to a trained eye, and especially a scientist, the arguments are superficial and pretentious. Most of their arguments can be pulled apart very easily and have only one layer of defense or validity, mainly based on the wording and picking their battles, where they address only issues where they could potentially provide seemingly good counter-arguments. 
   <br><br>

While I do think that climate deniers have created damage and delayed a lot of action, I think education is catching up with them. These people only have power over a niche audience nowadays. The only people we should focus our energy on are the "deniers" that have infiltrated government, and make sure they are out of there as soon as possible, and the only way to do that is not by fighting them directly, but through education. If we educate people, then they will make the right decisions themselves, and soon enough these people won't be in government.

After reading the article and watching Ken's video, I felt very frustrated with what I learned. Specifically, I discovered that scientists who choose to disagree on climate change are funded by fossil fuel industries. What this expresses to me is that fossil fuel companies are fully aware they're in the wrong and literally need to pay educated people to say they "disbelieve" true scientific findings. What was even more alarming about this is that these people target k-12 teachers, which is essentially targeting children. It's extremely upsetting to hear about this because climate change is going to most effect these children. If they are fed with such false information at such an impressionable age, they may begin to buy into I.T.
   <br><br>

I think it's great that Ken does expose us to this reality because with more people aware, there is a higher chance of putting a stop to I.T. The statistic that 97% scientists agree is seen nearly everywhere and I feel better that I have a stronger understanding of this now. The paper criticizes the IPCC additionally for only using information that supports what they want to say. However, the article itself is doing the same thing which in turn follows confirmation bias. Overall, I am glad to learn bout this dark, manipulative side because it will keep me a alert and aware when it comes to being fooled.

Reading the article and watching the lecture video back-to-back left me feeling very conflicted. In the article, I read a well-written, seemingly scientifically-backed article that would certainly prove to be convincing to an uninformed reader. And then I learned that institutes like Heartland and other fossil fuel interests were funding the distribution of this text to teachers, essentially with aims at young children. Like you said, feeding kids with information at such an impressionable age can be dangerous, especially if it concerns the future of their lives and the planet. 
   <br><br>


While it its goals and purpose seem dark and manipulative, I found some of the key points and summarizations to be rather convincing and thought-provoking. For one, they discussed that no single scientist has the education to cover the scope of knowledge that is required to tackle an issue like the climate crisis. Or when they discussed the natural variability of global temperature.Though seemingly convincing, I found attempts like these to be unsuccessful, as my previous knowledge and learning tell me otherwise. However, I worry for the vulnerable and those whom the fossil fuel interests are targeting.

I was enraged while reading the first 3 chapters of the book. I was disappointed, but not surprised that people would so confidently and thoroughly try to spread a disinformation campaign--especially aimed at children via educators! I could not believe how these authors and organization members would feel comfortable with themselves after doing this. I believe that if we don't mitigate the climate crisis, it will kill us all. How could any amount of money be worth that? 
   <br><br>
I was even more upset because my mom is a 3rd grade public school teacher. She is a climate activists and constantly talks about climate change to her students. She shows them pictures of oil spills, floods, fires, droughts, etc. while talking about CO2 and the greed of fossil fuels. She also explains what renewable energy is and how it works (there's solar panels forming a shade structure over the school parking lot, which she brings them to see and explore). She works very hard to integrate climate change into nearly everything she teaches--which she has to do by herself with no help since it is not part of the curriculum. She's also had to endure many climate denier parents nearly harassing her for teaching their children about the climate crisis. These parents often complain to the principle demanding that she be reprimanded or fired for teaching about climate change. She told me that if she had not been teaching in the same district for about 25 years, she would fear for her job because of these complaints. Clearly, it is hard enough to teach about climate change in classrooms (and this is in Southern California, no less). This is why this book frustrated me to no end. These people are taking advantage of vulnerable teachers and climate denier parents. Ken mentioning in his video that certain states have even tried to legally prevent teachers from teaching about climate change nearly made me explode. My mom's school has no rules against teaching about the climate crisis, yet it is already so difficult (even without receiving such awful literature from such terrible organizations). 
   <br><br>

Ken, if you read this comment, please tell us how to fight back against this. The youth cannot rise to fight to try to save the planet if they are the victims of disinformation campaigns. I want to stop this and let children be properly educated about the facts, but I don't know how to do it.

I most definitely agree with you that what these fossil fuel companies are doing are morally wrong and just flat out terrible for spreading false information on such a serious matter that everyone should be educated on no matter what age because it affects us all. These companies most definitely know what they are doing by attacking public schools and targeting the younger generations; it is much effortless to expose the younger generation with false information since they are so called easier to manipulate. This angers me because now I question what false information was I taught in my younger years? A lot im sure. And because our education system is also very corrupt, the generations that keep on coming will continue to lack a proper education, but that's if there even is a future for them. Very sad to think about because at the rate we are going there will be no future and these fossil fuel companies are oblivious to it. 
   <br><br>
Another thing I would like to mention is that I appreciate the fact that you mentioned your mothers experiences with teaching climate change to her third grade students. I am glad to hear that there are teachers out there such as your mother who go out of their way and teach their kids on serious topics such as climate change. I believe that everyone deserves to know the changes that are occurring to our earth and how these changes will impact our lives severely. So thank you to your mother on continuing to do what she does even with the backlash that she endures while doing so.


<br><Hr>

I agree with your disappointment about the fact that people are so confidently spreading a disinformation campaign to children via educators.  It is saddening that people would go this far just to spread false information about an issue that is ravaging the earth.  I was particularly interested in responding to your comment because my mom is also a public elementary school teacher who is met with challenges everyday because of her beliefs on climate change.  She also believes it is a real issue and tries to teach it to her class in the most efficient way possible.  I can only imagine the difficulty that our mothers go through to not only take on such a complicated topic like climate change but also to be met with complaints and denial.  It is frustrating to think there is such difficulty in teaching an urgent topic in the classroom like the climate crisis.  Because change begins in the classroom, I would think there would be little to no complaints about teaching this topic.  However, seeing that this topic is met with such disregard is making me think the future generation will not be fully aware about the extremities of this issue.  I hope that the education system will no longer promote an ideal that shelters elementary school children from knowing the real effects of the climate crisis.  At least in my experience of elementary school education, I was not taught about this issue even though I wish I was.  I believe it would be a disservice to this next generation if they are not given the full run down on this issue.  Sheltering children from knowing more about this topic will only result in a failed system of awareness.

<br><Hr>
I agree with you 100%. I grew up in a very liberal town and I have been lucky enough to have been learning about climate change since I was in 2nd grade. I think what your mom is doing is really inspiring, especially because she is doing despite the parents' complaints. It is so important to educate the next generation about human-caused climate change and how to solve it because they are much more likely to understand the intensity of the issue and might actually be able to do something about it. I find it ridiculous that many teachers aren’t allowed to teach climate change, and even if they are they many times still get ridiculed by the children’s parents. It is so unethical that “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change” was sent to so many teachers by fossil fuel companies. If people knew that's who was funding these books, they might think twice before believing what's written in them. If a teacher was on the fence about climate change their opinion could be easily swayed by a well-written book, which could then affect how all of their students are taught about the subject.

Reading this literature was frustrating, to say the least. Not only was it frustrating because of the arguments it was making against the climate change front, but because the arguments were well crafted and made sense. This was not written by some misinformed, ignorant skeptic who is just venting their frustrations about alarmists and the end of the world. It was written by someone who knows what they are talking about, and knows exactly how to poke holes in the fight against climate change. This raises a serious issue of modern human society -  one that may even parallel the climate crisis - the crisis of misinformation. The entire time I was reading these excerpts, I couldn't help but think "how much of this is true?" Some of the points they made about the 97% consensus, if grounded in fact, even caught me second guessing the validity of that claim. However steadfast I am in my belief in climate change, these authors do a very good job of undermining the belief. I can only imagine the sort of reinforcing effect this material would have on people who are already skeptical of the climate crisis. It is effectively an arsenal of questions and counterarguments that seem to logically invalidate the climate change consensus. But is any of it true? How the hell is anyone supposed to know what is real or not anymore? Even science, what we have hailed as our holy book of truth, has become a tool to be used and manipulated for the sake of politico-economic gain and control. If we can't trust the science, what can we trust?

I completely agree with your comment and while reading this weeks literature I was incredibly frustrated as well. I was also asking myself, what is the truth? At one point it felt like they were just throwing numbers and statistics at the reader and most would just accept them as facts but all they really did was confuse me instead of enforcing their argument. What struck me the most was reading the amazon reviews on this book. There was an incredible amount of 4-5 star reviews praising and agreeing with the anti-climate change ideals that greatly outweighed the 1 star reviews that were in agreement that there is climate change. This lets me know that this book is achieving its goal of not only getting people to agree that there is not a consensus on climate change but it is also causing believers of the climate crisis to become skeptical, which I could tell by not only the amazon reviews but also other comments on this video, and that is incredibly alarming to me.

I did find myself questioning a lot after reading "Why Scientists Disagree on Climate Change". The book was constructed in a way that fought a lot of the strongest climate change advocacies, like that "97% percent of scientists agree with anthropogenic climate change". In doing this, I really started to doubt myself, and the book does a good job at that. I have no qualifications or scientific knowledge, so it is easy to trust the facts that were listed. Learning, however, the people behind the book made me change my mind about it. The fact that it was funded by fossil fuel interests is no surprise to me, as it is a common theme with climate change deniers.  The book is well-cited, and includes many lists of references and studies, which makes readers begin to question themselves and who they support. It is hard to argue against lists of what seem to be credible scientific articles and journals. In looking deeper, however, seeing that this group used to be funded by tobacco companies stands to discredit them. Obviously smoking tobacco is bad for you. So is ignoring climate change.

<br><br>
The use of it being sent to be taught in schools, though, is vastly alarming. Kids only know what we teach them, and having a biased lesson like that can stand to halt the climate movement as a whole. After all, kids are the future. The climate movement cannot stand any more opposition, especially not in the youth, when we are fighting so hard against the boomer generation. I find it upsetting, and it feels very sneaky. Misinforming children to fuel your own monetary interests is wrong, and I don't understand the thought process. In tandem, the fact that climate change is banned from being talked about in some schools in particular states is also troubling, if we ban the conversation around issues, we stand to ignore them. Without acknowledging climate change and its effects, we are losing precious time to act. It's another tactic to distract us from the real issue, and damn is it probably really effective.

I agree with many of the points that you brought up in your comment. Upon reading “Why Scientists Disagree on Climate Change,” I was also questioning the legitimacy of arguments coming from both sides of the climate change debate. On one hand, I was raised and told that climate change does exist and that a majority of scientists in the world are in consensus when it comes to global climate change caused by mankind. However, the article was effective at disproving the IPCC’s hypothesis because it is carefully crafted to address every minute point in their work. The book uses statistics and scientific facts to disprove that the scientific field are in consensus that 97% of scientists agree with anthropogenic climate change. After reading the book I could see some glaring problems with the assumption of climate change and its impacts on the world. I also lack scientific knowledge whatsoever and so it was difficult for me to decide for myself what is true and what isn’t. Personally, I found some glaring problems with the book because it is constructed and funded by the Heartland Institute. As I read the description of the book, read some negative amazon reviews, and watched Ken’s youtube video I came to the realization of the book’s hypocrisy. One of the comments on Amazon emphasizes that “this book is published (and sent unsolicited to high school teachers) by the Heartland Institute, the biggest climate-denying organization in the US, probably in the world. They get massive donations from the fossil fuel lobby.” How can a book claim that the IPCC is a failure because it is meant to appeal to the government politicians when the skeptics are being funded the fossil fuel companies who are under immediate threat from the IPCC’s values? I agree with your note that this book can be an untrustworthy source because of its background, funders, and association with tobacco in the past. 

<br><br>

 From my point of view, the use of the book in academics to teach children to be skeptical of global climate change is more alarming than the alarmists who exaggerate the effects of man-made climate change. Kids cannot reason and question the things that are taught to them in school at an early age. Companies and organizations such as the Heartland Institute should not be allowed to ship free copies of a book pushing a certain agenda to be shoved down the throats of these kids. By targeting the youth, the climate change deniers are attacking the future and the ability for humanity to start making changes against climate change. I also agree with your argument that we should not ban the discussion of climate change in classrooms. Why can organization send books that attempt to disprove climate change’s harmful effects on the world while teachers are not allowed to have a valid discussion on the harmful effects of climate change? If we choose to ignore the issue in our classrooms it will only take longer for a new generation to take a stand against climate change. However as Ken pointed out in a previous lecture, we don’t have time to spare and every day counts if we wish to prevent the devastating of climate change to worsen and become the norm.

The initial two paragraphs in the Foreword of Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming made me reread them multiple times in shock of the political ideas suggested. These two paragraphs alone make strong claims and use suggestive language like, “these statements should ring alarm bells in the minds of all Americans.” The diction used encourages readers to find the writers credible and honest in comparison to the opposing party - those who “believe” in climate change. The writer of the foreword Marita Noon calls the climate crisis “the manmade-climate-change-scare scenario” which is almost humorous. Noon continues to call climate change claims exaggerations and says that predictions of climate catastrophe are unlikely to come true. She also brings up the so-called “alarmist” view on climate change which is highly upsetting because Noon and those with her like mind have a rather selfish view on why they oppose climate change. Because of environmental catastrophe and the obvious limits that the Earth is putting on human lifestyle, environmental “extremists” fight to influence policy change and in turn that will change certain aspects of everyday life like, Noon said, what kind of light bulbs we can buy and what cars we drive. Climate change non-believers feel that this is unfair and takes away human rights and the luxury of choice. Personally, this philosophy makes me angry and it’s even worse that this book is being pushed onto young children and attempting to brainwash their mindset on climate change. How could anything be more important than trying to stop climate change? It seems inhumane. 

<br><br>


I found it interesting how the author listed out the reasons for climate change “alarmists” seeming more productive in their mission and one of those reasons was government funding to find a human-caused impact on climate change rather than a natural cause. Along with the other reasons, it just sounds like an excuse to me. So far, I haven’t read any factual reasons or ideas as to why skeptics say climate change is not real. Like the 1-star Amazon review said, they are essentially just bringing up climate change facts and denying them without a solid rebuttal. 

<br><br>

I agree with Ken’s statement about education being important, especially in this context. Apart from the skeptics trying to infiltrate the education system with their lies, I can definitely see how an uneducated or uninformed person could read this book and wholeheartedly believe it. At times, I found myself reading sentences as fact (not that they are), but there’s definitely something to be said about the rhetoric used in this book. The diction is clear, concise, and honestly, sounds like any other academic work just with different content. The funding of these climate change deniers is worrisome because their books and online content could potentially lead people to either convert their beliefs or begin believing in climate change skeptic ideals when they had no interest in climate change before.

Alright… I’m feeling ambivalent inside my heart after reading this literature. I was just ready to kickoff my devotion to the climate crisis, while this book suddenly torqued me in a different direction. And the worst thing is that it does have evidence to support its opposition! 
<br><br>
At first, I was not expecting I would be converted to the other side, while the reading clearly introduced IPCC and the associated flaws regarding climate change. The priority of their argument is to dispute the claimed “consensus” of anthropogenic climate change by IPCC. Following that are specific reasons for scientists’ disagreement and politicization of the committee. 
<br><br>
As scientific research, the paper is well-structured, with key points, summarizations, and detailed illustrations of the topic, and I have no doubts about its sources since if the authors made the same mistakes as IPCC, it would be a huge blaster. Rather, I want to talk about my own attitudes and skeptics about this work, cuz according to the author, “consensus is the exception; skeptics are normal.”    I don’t know why but I’m always feeling the authors are nitpicky. Instead of using scientific terms, the paper is libeling IPCC with words in informal tones. Also, the author criticized IPCC of only gathering evidence favorable to their side, while actually, the paper is doing the same thing, making every effort to find even the minuscule error IPCC made, whether in numeric or logic. Therefore, as an audience, I did not generate inclination towards them. Furthermore, some of the statements throughout the passage is not a comparable reasoning to support their claim, such as this sentence: “There has never been any evidence of a climate scientist accepting money from industry to take a position or change his or her position in the climate debate (Cook, 2014).” Even though you remark that this is a valid citation from some credible source, but hey, it should not be counted as a potent fact! It is also an opinion rather than truth. Thus, though it has plenty of professional analysis, due to the mixed-in unworthy sentences like the above one, what I view this paper is just a quarrel in a scientific name. And I will still keep objective considering the problem, not pro not anti.

I completely agree that this book fails to make a truly strong and supported argument. If there’s one word to describe this book, it’s frustrating. It’s not only filled with blatant irony and uncensored bias, but it seems as if the only goal is to inundate the reader with so many studies and arguments that they are left utterly confused. In its attempt to “debunk” Nasa’s claim that 97% of scientists agree that human causes are excelling global climate change, the authors use studies that seem to follow the same procedure as the studies that they critique for being false and unreliable. The irony is truly unreal. It’s as if they know that the argument their making is purely sourced from their own self-interest pursuits to dismantle climate change rather than from any true foundation of skepticism they might have. Although, one cannot ignore the fact that this book brings up many valid points, such as the lack of depth in Oreskes study, the low response rate and small sampling size of Doran and Zimmerman’s study, and how Anderegg and Cook are not reliable sources. It’s a shame then, that their book also lacks any of its own reliable factual evidence. For example, when talking about the percent of AMS members that supported the statement in the IPCC, they made the argument that political ideology heavily influenced one’s view on climate change and then made the broad assumption that most, if not all, AMS members are liberals. This assumption was made without any supporting evidence and consequently diminishes any reputability the authors had to make valid arguments against anthropogenic climate change.
<br><br>
This book also heavily relies on pointing out the bias of the IPCC and many scientists that might research climate change. I found this amusing because they say that the IPCC is only focused on researching the human causes of climate change, which is quite literally their established job created by the government. They use this point to try and convince the reader that the findings done by the IPCC should not be taken into account because it’s their intention to discover the human causes. This makes absolutely no sense. Of course, the IPCC is going to be focusing on how humans are causing climate change, which to some extent will have an influence on their findings, but this doesn’t mean that all of their work should be completely dismissed. By following this logic it could then be said that all research projects that include hypotheses, which they all should, should also be dismissed as bias. Not to mention that this whole book is influenced by the bias of a group of people and should therefore also be dismissed? Their argument here is faulty and it makes it hard to take into account what is being said in the book when there are so many errors in logic.

After reading “why scientists disagree on climate change” I too found myself in a state of disbelief. Although they had not convinced me to change my position on climate change, I now have an understanding of why some people don’t believe in climate change. They were able to accomplish this by ultimately bringing into question the legitimacy of the claims made by supporters of climate change theory. The majority of what I read of the article was meant to discredit statistics that have been adopted by the climate change community. Key to their plan is to convince the reader that the most widely quoted statistic, “97% of scientist agree that climate change is real, caused by humans, and is harmful to the planet”, is wrong. The article also found small loopholes in the theories presented to defend climate change. One thing that was pretty clear to me while reading was the clear connection they drew to political affiliation and belief in climate change. “President Barack Obama and his followers have repeatedly declared that climate change is “the greatest threat facing mankind” (Noon xi). It disappoints me when people make clearly bi-partisan issues into yet another point of contention between the two-party system. This not only insights conflict between the parties, but almost removes the participation of fossil fuel associates from the picture. It is of great importance that we heed prof. Ken’s words that just about every study done with the intention of undermining and discrediting those who seek to bring climate change to the forefront are almost entirely funded by fossil fuel interests.

Thinking about how 300,000 copies of this book were sent to K-12 teachers with the purpose of this knowledge being distributed to children is unnerving. Nowadays, with public information so easily accessible but also often inaccurate, I find it difficult to find the truth in the information I search online. By learning in school that the climate crisis does not exist, children will be more likely to believe this, and therefore, they will grow up without any urgency to help the environment. Even if the statements in this book are true, and human action is not the main cause of global warming, I still think we should take measures to reduce the damage we are inflicting on the planet. This goes along with the precautionary principle stated by the IPCC- “Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.” Although the book claims this is an invalid excuse to increase costs and destroy industries, I think efforts towards saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are worth it; it’s a win-win situation that betters our planet, regardless of whether we started the problem or not.
<br><br>


Overall, I had very mixed feelings about this book because I do believe in anthropogenic climate change, but it forced me to second-guess my beliefs. It made me feel as if I was in the wrong and ridiculously misinformed, in spite of the overwhelming evidence I’ve seen that supports human-related climate change. I’m hoping to gain some clarity on whether their arguments were valid or not. At the same time, it just reminded me that people such as the authors and scientists quoted in this book are one of the many reasons that the climate crisis exists. They are creating another obstacle that prevents this situation from becoming any worse, discouraging people across the globe from taking the real and necessary steps.

I think that your last point is important. Noting that the “authors and scientists quoted in this book are one of the many reasons that the climate crisis exists” is an important distinction, as they are such a small minority. Perusing the sources listed in the PDF, reviewing the author’s credentials, it is trivial to see authors with incredible histories of bias and little to no real support. One example of this would be Richard Lindzen, who was (and is) referenced as a retired MIT scientist. His views were rebuked by his colleagues, who wrote a letter to President Trump signed by 22 current and retired climate scientists: http://climate-science.mit.edu/news/featured-stories/mit-faculty-working-on-climate-write-to-president-trump. This pattern is pervasive with the authors of the text and other references. Inflated titles and seemingly important corporation titles, are unsurprisingly veils over partisan organizations.


<br><hr>
The inflated titles of the references that you mention is definitely impacting the public's views. It requires deeper analysis and research in order to realize that their sources are biased and/or inaccurate, but the average American is likely to just believe their words at first glance, which is why I think this book is especially dangerous.

First off, I don’t have a problem with weighing both sides of an argument. In fact, I am of the mind that being challenged in one’s own opinion is one of the best ways to grow and learn. At the same time, I have a very serious problem with a deceptive and purposeful attempt to create chaos in the minds of the American people, especially in schools. Now more than ever, I believe that we need to do a better job of creating and maintaining clarity and spreading legitimate information in credible ways. This text only adds fuel to the fire that is the age of misinformation. A quick stop at The Heartland Institute website reveals the following self-description, “The Heartland Institute plays an essential role in the national (and increasingly in the international) movement for personal liberty and limited government.” Read: we are a politically motivated body that works to decrease governmental influence and promote individual liberties through free market economies. While the general mission of the insitute is totally within their rights, it seems extremely hypocritical to me to present themselves as the clean-slated backer of a quasi-textbook when the institute can’t even release its list of donors due to backlash. 
<br><br>


The text emphasizes the importance of presenting unbiased information, limiting alarmists, and giving people the tools to formulate their own opinions but literally opens with a foreword attempting to undermine the Obama Administration’s green initiatives with misdirection toward ISIS as a more terrifying issue which ought to occupy everyone’s minds. While I don’t doubt the significance of ISIS from a global safety perspective, especially at the time this was published, I believe it was totally inappropriate to juxtapose the two issues as if we cannot deal with both. The sources behind the creation of this text and solicitation of America’s teachers is essentially a self-proclaimed conservative/libertarian enterprise which advocates for free markets and limited government intervention. Again, I have no problem with leaning toward one idealogy over another at the base level. But despite specifically criticizing the impact of political agendas on scientific research and reporting, the text was backed by this and other organizations who have made a business of perpetuating politicized arguments while operating as a non-profit. With this being the case, it again comes as no surprise that the focus of the text from the cover through the first three chapters is on discrediting the most common understandings of climate change. My biggest problem with this text was that the arguments were almost entirely hypocritical. The text utilizes buzzwords and blanket statements about what science is to lend itself credibility throughout the paper. Meanwhile, there is little to no new evidence presented to actually contradict the arguments that are supposedly “debunked” in the text. Even if some entities to liberties in the use of the term consensus, arguing against the idea of consensus itself does nothing to show the data, models, predictions, etc. are flawed. Furthermore the argument of confirmation bias, that climate “alarmists” utilized arbitrary figures to support their claims, is again totally hypocritical when the text bases nearly the entire argument on one 18/19 year measurement of temperature change. It doesn’t take a Ph.D in statistics (though they would probably demand one) to know that you could start with any year with relatively high results for that immediate era and end with one with relatively low results to get a single measure like that.

I agree with you in that the authors of this book appeared very hypocritical upon closer inspection of what they were saying.  The book was obviously written to appear as scientifically based and non biased as possible, a counter to the "biased and corrupt" IPCC, when in reality it is quite the other way around.  Right off the bat they champion themselves as a group independent from governmental and private interests, the underdogs fighting the IPCC who is politically based and inherently biased.  They state that they aren't funded by any government body and are independent from fossil fuel money.  However it doesn't take a genius to disprove this, literally a two minute google search showed me that the Heartland Institute from which they are based received nearly $25.6 million USD  from huge fossil fuel companies.  Of course I wasn't surprised, but the problem is that it may not be so obvious for the people they are targeting with this literature.  They send it to teachers, politicians, and any influential people they think may be able to be if not convinced, at least conflicted by this new "scientific" book.   The hypocrisy goes even further than arguing that the IPCC is corrupt however as so many of the points they used to discredit the IPCC could be applied to them, and they weren't even hiding it.  A favorite section of mine was when they spent a huge portion of chapter 1 arguing that the IPCC cherry picks data from sources that support their views.  They argued that the IPCC did nothing to gather evidence on their null hypothesis that climate change is not an issue, and only looked for sources that supported their confirmation bias.  That whole section is immediately followed by them talking about their own research methods, and this quote, "NIPCC authors paid special attention to research that was either
 <br><br>
overlooked by IPCC or contains data, discussion, or implications arguing against IPCC’s claim that dangerous global warming is resulting, or will result, from human-related greenhouse gas emissions."  It is honestly amusing to me, albeit in a depressing way, that they are so blatantly suffering from the exact same confirmation bias, corruption, and questionable at best research methods that they "discredit" the IPCC for.  If only more people could read between the  lines of the scientific sounding book, and see that it is about at biased and self interested as it can get.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that it is very important to weigh both sides of the argument. If there was a new scientific finding based in solid concrete facts that countered the common stance on the climate change issue then I believe it should be listened to and heard out. However, this text is not that. As you stated in your comment the text is more filled with clever statements to convince readers using misinformation, deception and flawed experiments and data analysis. I honestly don't have a problem with political think-tanks in general because both parties use them to help push their agendas. However the issue of climate change shouldn't be a political issue and for that reason I think the misinformation spread on the topic by these think tanks is wrong as climate change is less of a morality/belief based issue. The opening chapters are very convincing only because they draw the reader in and really cause them to question scientist at a base level however once you delve deeper into where they draw their information from it is easy to see the falsifications within their argument.

<br><hr>

I too appreciate two sides of an argument and learning from several perspectives, however, it pains me to read a book that advertises as unbiased and seeking some kind of “real look” into climate change data, but, instead, manipulates its audience to inherently learn from fossil fuel company biases. The fact that money and power can bring companies to trick educators into teaching biased information to our youth in order to keep the fossil fuel industry alive, is terrifying. Reading all of the statistics, numbers, and arguments they include to undermine the IPCC’s claims on the relevant dangers of climate change because they are a “political and biased” source, shows their hypocrisy. Because this book is deceivingly providing biased facts on pressing issues, I feel more influence to fact check all information that I read in order to get the best information possible. 
 <br><br>


I believe the fossil fuel industries are targeting educators because the youth is the most influential group to target and the future for their businesses. If the youth doesn’t believe in climate change, who’s going to be the change we need to limit these fossil fuel industries? The youth is a group that inevitably decides the fate of our efforts in limiting the climate crisis, so it’s no mystery why fossil fuel industries would fund Heartland institute 25.6 million USD in order to get the book Why Scientists Disagree about Climate Change published.

<br><hr>
I too feel that it is important for people to look at both sides of an argument so that they can make their own unbiased opinions. There is a difference though, as you pointed out, between providing legitimate, reliable facts to support one's argument and using deceptive propaganda to sway public opinion for personal gain. Although the text could be quite convincing at times, I frequently questioned the legitimacy of the claims made because there was no original evidence or data to support these claims that climate change isn't human caused. This was a big red flag to me because a statement as bold as "climate change isn't a big deal" should have some pretty solid evidence to back it up and should not solely rely on trashing the opposing view to boost its credibility. 
 <br><br>


 I think that you made a really great point when you stated that it "was totally inappropriate [of the authors] to juxtapose the two issues (ISIS and climate change) as if we cannot deal with both". Many climate deniers in politics say that we have bigger fish to fry and don't have the time or supplies or money to prioritize the issue of climate change right now. Yet, here we are, somehow spending hundreds of billions of dollars on Space Force. It is not that the government cannot deal with climate change and other issues simultaneously, it is that they won't. Just like The Heartland Institute, many of our politicians are being funded and supported by companies that thrive off of extracting fossil fuels and other practices that are harmful to the environment.
<br><hr>
I like everything that you had to say. To add on to that list of hypocritical things that climate change deniers have done, I’m sitting here thinking about what Ken said regarding the billboard with the unabomber saying “I still believe in climate change. Do you?” Like do climate change deniers know what we could put on a billboard? I kept thinking of different prominent climate change deniers, but in the end I think the most effective billboard would just be a barrel of oil that read “I don’t believe in climate change, but I also don’t have family in Miami.” 
 <br><br>

It’s frustrating that deniers target teachers, legislators, and businesspeople but quite frankly, who else did we think they would target? They want to get at the root of our society, children who trust their teachers more than anyone. As I was reading, I was reminded of all of my teachers growing up-none of them talked about climate change at all. But they did talk about how to write well. And these authors didn’t get the memo. There were so many unsubstantiated claims it was painful. The authors would just throw in a wildly inaccurate sentence and then close the paragraph. No analysis needed, I guess. They should’ve hired real writers, it would’ve flowed much nicer, and (as a bonus) the writers would probably know more about anthropogenic climate change than the oil companies that wrote it.
<br><hr>


I agree with you when you say it's important for both sides of an argument to be presented, but I do agree that it is so incredibly frustrating that climate change is where we even have two arguments to be presented with. I tried to approach this text with no bias that I believed in the harms produced by anthropogenic climate change because I wanted to see what it would be like for the average person who stumbled across this text before any other information to be able to make a judgement based off of it. I found that the way this text was written was somewhat suspicious. I think it's strange that each essay is a page and a half long with three sources after. None of the papers hit any big scientific claims other than picking out details from studies and opinion papers already done to destroy the 97% consensus argument. The first two chapters felt like I was reading the same thing over and over, with no new angle.
 <br><br>


I can see how Ken warned us that we may become a little convinced. A few of the passages in the first chapter, specifically under Flawed Surveys where different deniers assess Naomi Oreskes' 97% claim did reveal some questions for me. Did he/she/they really just do a CTRL F of "global climate change" and conclude that 97% of the searches came up meant a consensus? I somehow find that incredibly skeptical, but I'll have to admit, the text did put the doubt in my head. Even though these deniers had a minimal amount of "good points" or points of thought, none of them used hard data or facts to convince me that climate change is not caused anthropogenically. They simply just pointed out tiny fallacies in the 97% that do. 

 <br><br>

I leave this text feeling confused. Which I think may be one Heartland's goals: to leave the reader doubtful, confused, unsettled, and overwhelmed. And with that, I think they may have succeeded. Speaking from the perspective of someone who believes in anthropogenic climate change, I feel as though this text only makes it harder for people to have trust in the world. Optimism is so difficult to maintain when people are constantly telling you nothing is safe to believe. The fact that we cannot agree scares me just as much as the effects of climate change do, because we cannot unite and face the issue head on as a country. How sad and scary is the inability to affect change?
<br><hr>

I agree with the statement that you make about how there is no problem in learning about both sides of the climate change argument. I believe that it is beneficial for everyone to have a well-rounded knowledge about climate change, specially because it is one of the most relevant issues of our time. However, as I was reading the first three chapters of this book I did not really enjoy the reading, as I thought that it was extremely repetitive and had no good argument to counterattack the most commonly accepted view of climate change. I too believe that the text is very hypocritical, like Jason mentioned, specially since it talks so much about the issue of climate change alarmists being politically biased. In all honesty, I thought that if anything this text was extremely biased, as its only purpose was to delegitimize the view that climate change was caused by humans. Their evidence did not point clearly in the direction that anthropogenic climate change is not real, and they kind of just threw data on a piece of paper and called it a book. Overall I did not enjoy reading this text.
 <br><br>
To answer Ken I think that it is extremely important to educate children on climate change, but of course in order to that we must start with the teachers. It is important to provide teachers with accurate, unbiased information about the truth of climate change. I think that it is extremely important for schools to teach about this since the children that will now be learning about it, will be affected by this issue their whole lives, therefore it is important for them to have the facts on the matter.
<br><hr>
I think your point on the deceptive spreading of information is important to recognize. It’s disgusting that the texts present itself as credible and unbiased, even though they persuade the reader rather than inform. This is evident through the text’s use of misinformation through misleading data or ideas in addition to clever yet obviously bias rhetoric. There is a clear agenda that the texts are trying to convey and it relies on unverified evidence. However, the way the information is presented deceptively leads one to believe that the facts are unbiased and supported. 

 <br><br>

Perhaps what’s most concerning to me is the fact that I may have been deceived had I not been so well informed on this issue through this class. Stepping back from the reading, I did have this sense of confusion. If I was not taking this class and my knowledge on climate change was limited, I may feel doubtful and confused after reading the text. Seeing and reading their deceptive tactics helped me comprehend how opposition against climate change is spread and strengthened. I found the deceptive nature of the reading every frustrating. Climate change should be made more aware to people so radical change can take place. However, all this is inevitably hindered by the spread of misinformation that do more to create chaos rather than inform.

<br><hr>
I agree with the statement that we should always weigh both sides of the argument before forming an opinion. This book gave us, as students and people who care about this crisis to be able to do this. Before reading these 59 pages, I went in without a seed of doubt in my mind that climate change is real and I still do believe that. However, this book really did question my beliefs on this topic with seemingly so much evidence that many scientists do not believe it. The first chapter was just filled with studies that many people have read about and gave them information about this crisis, but this book just gave information about how it was "methodically incorrect" and pointed out the flaws in each study. This created some doubt in my mind, because I had never thought of these scientific studies like this before. The book gave a great argument against climate crisis, even though they promised an unbiased view. Instead of giving two sides of the argument, they basically only gave one by calling each study unreliable and pointing out every single flaw. However, they did have solid points like how the government only funds studies and research to find climate change as anthropogenic. This point actually did mess with my head, as that logic is very true, but I have seen the evidence and read so many articles about why humans have caused it that I knew that was just a point against it. Reading other comments, it seems to be that this book was funded by fossil fuel companies to spread misinformation and try to create more skeptics about this issue. I find this completely ironic as they even stated in the introduction how scientists are paid by fossil fuel companies to sow doubt into the mind, just like this book was. I think it is important to see both sides of the argument, but I don't think this book is a good way to see the other side of the debate.

<br><hr>
the first thing that caught my eye when scrolling through the YouTube comments was your opening statement of being open minded and looking at both sides of the argument. This led me to believe that your comment was not only informative but also credible. And I was right. I also found The Heartland Institute book to be extremely hypocritical, accusing the IPCC of pushing a political agenda when they are the ones trying to implement their own ideas about climate change and give themselves the advantage in order to push their own political agenda. I was, like most others, very convinced at first by the book "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming", until thoroughly researching The Heartland Institute and what they stand for, as well as the insight gained from listening to Ken's lecture. For instance, I hadn't realized that heartland was primarily fueled by big fossil fuel interests like the Koch brothers. I also was astounded at the perplexity and delicacy with which the authors of this book were able to sneak in hints of doubt and skepticism. It was as if they were saying that just because no one directly 100% agreed they were wrong, that that made them right. It was so bizarre, I felt like I was watching one of those Netflix shows where they go through and try to prove crazy conspiracy theories. They were very convincing for a number of different reasons, some of which you mentioned in your above comment. I thought that with all the so-called "peer-reviewed" articles and papers that they had that meant they were credible. It turns out that many of their sources were simply their own people backing up their claims. Not to mention the first three chapters (and I'm sure the rest of the book followed this pattern as well) were simply the heartland institute people trying to falsify the other sides claims instead of making their own point. This scares me, especially knowing that 300,000 copies of this book have been sent out to school teachers all across the U.S. Sure they said that some academics disagreed upon consensus and that maybe this was the point they were trying to make, but simply stating one swayed point of view from one, maybe two people who have differing opinions based on their own biases does not make a strong case or argument. All of this being said, I am impressed with the ferocity and convincing nature of the Heartland Institute, and I can see how they appeal to people who don't believe or simply don't want to believe in the climate crisis that is at hand.

<br><hr>

Well said. This plague of fake news and trends of spreading misinformation is like the boy who cried wolf. With so many differing opinions and his/her words vs there words, its very hard to differential between justifiable arguments and persuasively inaccurate ones. At some point, all you can hear is words and more messages flooding us with information.
 <br><br>

Being naïve, I used to think books were credible sources of information, because if someone took the time and energy to author something, it would be their best work put forward. However, the motivations inspiring the publication and distribution of this text is corruption. This deceitfulness of the mass population is a plague on our society. Twisted truths and lies of omissions are discovered between the lines of the pages. Looking at the facts, they've based their rebuttle of hypocrisy and no science to back it up. Escalating cooling is the intermittent cold (decreasing) plot point periods in a longer range of increasingly sloping graphs. One disregarding the bigger picture is manipulating data and dishonest statistics. The accusers are pointing their fingers back at the innocent, causing distractions to create a two-sided argument.  By gaining supporters from those not aware or capable of forming their own opinions is even more manipulative. Children taught climate change skeptics by way of influencing school teachers is evil. Hypothetically, how do you annihilate a society most effectively? by killing all the youth and children, disrupting the cycle of new beginnings. The parallelism is shocking between these points, as the fake propoganda is doing just that with this book. 
 <br><br>

Its also a major red flag if the funding for these types of book are the fossil fuel industry. That’s like illegally betting to change the outcome of a sports event in favor of your gambling interests. These fossil fuel companies are so giant, it is hard to regulate their fraudulent activities. It is even harder to convict a corporation of wrongdoing and illegal activity, especially if there support rest in the hands of policy makers and elected officials loyal to them. It's so easy in life to put self-interests above the common good. As money and power normally does, it corrupts.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that this article is very deceptive. I myself believe that people these days are extremely rigid about their opinions in politics and in general. To me, that usually leads to a stubbornness that doesn’t allow us to move forward as a nation. I think that education plays a huge role in our ability to take action because understanding other arguments and opinions allows us to come to our own conclusions instead of following whatever people around us believe. This is where I am very thankful to have the education that I received. On the surface, the article was quite convincing, and if it's the only information I'd received, I'd believe it. This is where the problem lies. Too many people just follow the politics of those around them. Since denying climate change is a conservative position, I feel like a lot of people just accept that it's not true simply because that's the only information they ever intake. A copy of this article was sent out of 300,000 people for free. Its reach is far and many people are going to side with its statements. I’ve done the research, and I believe that climate change does exist, independent of politics. The problem is that it has become a political issue. No liberal wants to take a conservative stance and vise versa; that’s why it becomes easy to influence many conservative people that climate change doesn’t exist. They are inclined to believe what other conservatives believe. To anyone reading this comment, I ask this, do you believe all climate change deniers are dumb? I don’t, I think that most of the time people don’t try to educate in a friendly manner, but rather try to attack others in politics. This simply causes people to double down on what they already believed. In my opinion, we have to take politics out of the situation and try to educate people without making them feel attacked or wrong.

I respect your statement regarding the tolerance to weigh both sides of an issue. I too believe that it is of upmost importance to consider all the facts and perspectives of certain issues in order to not only solidify one's own opinion, but to learn new takes on the issue as well. However, I can totally see how the specific issue of climate change in this case is becoming a chaotic battle between scholarly presented articles presenting facts construed to support their individual arguments. Even as someone who has learned about the FACTS of our current climate and the scientific explanations as to why strange natural events are beginning to occur, it is true that the "Why Scientists Disagree" article did present an argument against the urgent nature of the climate crisis that spits out so many alleged "inconsistencies" that made me consider if the effects of humans on the Earth is so severe after all. What's even more sickening to me is the idea of this company sending out their book to American educators in hopes of influencing, or at least providing doubt in the minds of the youth. Once again, it is healthy to consider alternate viewpoints, but to maliciously and blatantly create a book specifically designed to misconstrue the real life facts especially to learning children is wrong in my books. Lastly, in the book's Key Findings section towards the beginning, it states that individual nations should take charge of setting their own climate policies based on particular geographies. This approach stuck out to me most notably and I find it disturbing mostly because the environment is a home to every single human being despite what country or region one resides in. Without international, let alone national collaboration, Planet Earth will fail to see the change she so desperately needs.


<br><hr>
While considering both sides of an argument is important, it is even more important to reach a concrete conclusion at the end of these considerations. There are many issues where a middle ground is simply nonsensical, and climate change is one of them. This is where spreading seeds of doubt is good enough for these conservative think tanks, since weak attempts at action in a crisis is enough to continue the business of the fossil fuel and related industries. While I agree with the institute having the right to exist, I feel there should be significant efforts made against them, especially considering transparency of donors. What really stuck out to me was how many corporate donors (e.g. GM) of Heartland pulled out when they were leaked donors. The Institute confirmed that they pulled out of fear for their public image. If setting the record straight on climate change is such a noble cause as they claim, then why would corporate donors pull out when they're exposed? While they claim to be an apolitical body, their interests line up concretely with those of the Republican party.

Your next point about the foreword bringing ISIS in the first paragraph is especially good. It's an emotionally charged statement that reads like a non sequitur when considering that the climate actually is a crisis. The quoting of Einstein was especially ignorant. It doesn't change the fact that we can move forward to create useful technologies or policy changes when consensus is generally reached, just as how quantum computers are well into development despite many uncertainties regarding the field of quantum physics. Similarly, we should go off of the current scientific consensus of climate change to inform public policy and personal lifestyle choices. The fact that the text would likely demand a Ph.D in statistics that you pointed out is a surprisingly revealing one. They demanded absolute certainty in credentials when not at all necessary. For example, concerning specialization, the book acts as though fields are completely separated, never interacting with each other to reach conclusions or new understanding. It acts like biologists only talk with other biologists, etc. That argument is completely absurd, since interdisciplinary communication is so integral to virtually all scientific debate.

I agree with you that's important to see both sides of an argument. However, it's important that the information about the different sides is accurate. Neither side should fudge information to make their perspective seem like the correct one. It's interesting to me how a person who doesn't believe in climate change can't see that the things that start climate change are still bad for other reasons. Factory farming cattle isn't just bad because it adds access methane into the atmosphere. It is also bad because it takes up land, uses up water, and also is the result of the death of innocent creatures. Cars running on oil aren't just bad because the CO2 admission causesglobal warming. They are also bad because oil isn't a permanent resource and it will eventually run out. Not to mention so much destruction happens when oil is drilled. If you really want to use the excuse "the climate is always changing" to say why climate change isn't real, fine. But what are your other excuses for all the other environmental problems that aren't climate change?

Similarly, I think that is both horrible and genius that they target kids. Children are the future so it makes sense why they are targeting elementary schools. It reminds me of how Fast-food companies target kids with toys in the meals.

I also see the importance of being informed about the counter arguments of an issue. To fully understand what climate change is—it’s essential to know what it isn’t: a political move, overreacting, or anything less than urgent. What is important to notice is the abundant amount of scientific evidence supporting climate change. If people know about these facts that prove its urgency, it will surely outweigh the repetitive claims made by people arguing against it. “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” uses non-scientific statements of doubt to remove the public’s focus from the true issue. It’s truly sad to see the corruption of money, power, and the media. Climate change shouldn’t be an argument, or something people try to convince people to believe. This present, and ever-growing issue requires union, and somehow the power of these fossil fuel companies is strong enough to create division in not only the U.S., but the world. 
 <br><br>

It’s important for people who can see past educator’s misleading texts to inform people about climate change. Scientific facts that support climate change display the real, insidious problem that influential people try to blind the public from. While reading this, I realized the power in informing. We are obligated to address people’s doubts—even if they seem irrational—for even books as misleading as this one can influence many.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that it is important to weigh both sides of an argument and that being challenged in one's own opinion is one of the best ways to grow and learn, but also that we need to do a better job as communicators to maintain clarity and spread legitimate information in credible ways. What I found some humor in about this text is how they sent about 300,000 unsolicited copies out to people like teachers and educators - showing the need to advance their agenda, a biased text funded by fossil fuel interests. However, unfortunately I do not find humor in how this text is actually very well put together to create skepticism and its success in creating doubt about the issue. 
 <br><br>


I also completely agree that the arguments in the text are completely hypocritical, and the text does little to actually debunk arguments with hard scientific evidence. Clearly they use skewed support for their arguments, such as the one measurement of a range of 19 years of climate change. Also, in class, I found it skewed (as well as kind of humorous) that the Heartland Institute references its own research to support its arguments, while it also cites real, sound climate data only to say it is false. At a deeper look, this text is clearly skewed, but unfortunately it does a great job of creating skepticism that is evident through the fact that only about 45% of high school teachers believed that 81 to 100 percent of scientists agree on anthropogenic climate change. The truth needs to find its way out, as it is important that educators guiding the children of the future know and teach the truth.

<br><hr>

The fact that many schools received the text and that teachers are already confused was concerning for me. Impressionable and perplexed teachers could be spreading false information to even more impressionable and perplexed children. 
 <br><br>
In high school, I took AP Environmental Science. It was supposed to be the class that changed the way I saw the world. Unfortunately, it was the first time my teacher was teaching the class. It left me more confused and misled than I felt before the class started. If more emphasis on environmentalism was present in schools then young people could have a strong platform to utilize completely to their advantage. Instead, my old high school didn’t even have recycling bins out near lunch tables, the cafeteria, and so forth. There was a lot of food and plastic that could have been composted/recycled, yet I wasn’t even aware of public compost bins until I started university here at UCSB. Emphasis on sustainable living habits are crucial to continuing the fight against climate change. We may not be able to end fracking, but schools should have more say, education, and understanding in what their students are exposed to.
 <br><br>
I agree with you that the juxtaposition between ISIS and the climate crisis was grossly inappropriate. While reading the text, I felt that the reporting was supposed to come off as unbiased and not skewed, but instead it came off as evasive.

I too agree that weighing both sides of an argument is part of making an informed decision. After reading the front material and chapters 1-3 of the book Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, initially it does come across as convincing. But if one takes a deeper look at their sources of reference, the publisher of the book, and the actions the publisher is taking to spread their book’s ideas, they raise questionable behavior. It’s kind of “sus.” Ken states that the Heartland Institute is a conservative think tank funded by fossil fuel companies, like the Koch Brothers. The Heartland Institute published this book, used many references from their own Institute for their book, and gave out this book to elected officials, business leaders, American teachers, and other opinion leaders for free. Is that not propaganda? Another problematic observation I had after reading the first few chapters was how the text revolves around pointing out the shortcomings and unreliability of research backing human-caused climate change. I guess what I am realizing while I write my own comment is that if one is to make an informed decision about whether they believe in human-caused climate change or not, one should compare research findings from scientists on both sides, instead of relying on the 2 cents from inherently biased private think-tanks like the Heartland Institute. It is their right to be able to put out written text like this book, but I think the facts show that the Heartland Institute is not a credible source of information and that they are trying to convince naive, skeptical Americans to believe their words that bash the other side. Anyone who puts down the opponent to make their views look better instead of using fair arguments should be questioned.

<br><hr>
I too believe that both sides of an argument should be considered when dealing with important issues so that one can come to the best possible conclusion for all involved. However, like you, the information touted in this book bothers me because it relies on “facts” supported by a very small group of scientists (3%), many of whom are backed by fossil fuels and other large corporations who benefit from results denying climate change. And, while I know one could make the argument that the majority is not always right, as at one point the majority of individuals thought the sun and planets in our solar system revolved around the Earth, this minority of scientists cannot be trusted due to the source of their funding. In addition, though I did sometimes find the rhetoric of the text convincing, I could not believe it because I have seen graphs of how temperatures have changed in the past century and even though there are slight bouts of cooling it is obvious that overall the temperatures are rising. And these rising temperatures correlate with rising CO2 and greenhouse gases making me agree with the 97% of scientists over the 3% represented in this book.

Wow, what a war tactic. Posting the PDF free online and having teachers from Primary education carry out their views, these conservative think-tanks really want people on their side. Honestly, I was quite convinced as some points in the book because they really laid out a solid argument or denying climate change. Having a little scientific background myself, I do to an extent believe that the only way to fully understand a concept yourself is to go out and do the experiment and do so without bias or doubt.  Only then you can really believe the results. But realistically, the majority of us can not go and conduct such research as we wish, and thus we are left to trust other researchers. The arguments that we have for the deniers can also be used against us for, in reality, we too trust what we want to trust. I think this is precisely what the fossil industries want, to delay acts that will stop them from mining and drilling, and the more time that they can buy by poisoning the youth, the more money they will make. It is just quite sad how low they are willing to go for cash.

The first few chapters of the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” talked about how little consensus there really is on the issue of climate change within the scientific community. Although this was published 5 years ago I still believe it is widely accepted now that climate change exists, it is here now, and it is very much real. What is unfortunate about Americans is that we are highly influenced by the media and campaigns that make claims that climate change is a hoax and we shouldn’t be worried. Sadly, books like this just add to people’s hesitation towards climate change being a problem which is incredibly upsetting because like professor Hiltner stated in this video, some of the people who are hesitant are teachers. The reason being is because they are not well educated on the issue, therefore, they do not feel comfortable teaching their students about it, which continues to feed into the trend of uneducated people as well as making them prone to misinformation about climate change. Another good thing to notes is that most of the time those who are pushing that climate change is fake agenda tend to work for huge companies trying to take the pressure off of themselves for being the main contributors to fossil fuel emissions. The book itself was well organized and written, although its content was less than impressive. Climate change is not a debate, it is not a question of “does it exist, is it happening, are humans the cause?” anymore. It is clear that climate change is an issue and we are the reason why it has gotten so out of hand. This isn’t a political issue as many try to make it, pitting “left-winged” individuals against “right-winged” stating that the liberals are trying to push their agenda down everyone’s throats. This is a human issue and it affects everyone and everything on Earth. People need to be educated correctly on what exactly. Climate change is, how it started, and what we need to do to stop it. I’m tired of reading articles and watching videos on how climate change is a joke and we have nothing to worry about because that is the furthest thing from the truth.

This book is so full of shit it makes me mad. Here are some reasons why no one should believe this garbage. 
 <br><br>


First, and possibly most important, the Heartland Institute is funded not by public scientists or non-bias third parties that wish to put their name on such contributions, but is rather funded by organizations like Koch industries, ExxonMobil, and very large anonymous donations. Public funding for research, on the other hand, is viewed as inherently bias, especially publications that were funded by the bureaucracy under the Obama Administration. 
 <br><br>


Second, a staple of this reading was its tricky wording and use of Red Haring arguments. 
 <br><br>
-Climate change activists desperate to spread to word out become "hyper-active alarmists". 
 <br><br>
-Older scientists in denial of climate change (ok boomer) become "emeritus" members of the academic community simply less eager to publish.
 <br><br>
-Individual scientists who are raising the the alarm on climate change lack an understanding of other fields of science in a significant enough manner to be taken seriously, but when they work together with other scientists in other fields it is seen as "resume padding" to skirt past an ivory-tower peer review process. 

 <br><br>

Third, when attacking the IPCC, the book demonizes "rent-seeking" renewable energy corporations, countering with a laundry list of false dichotomies that attempt to shove the force of climate change denial away from fossil fuel corporations and toward genuine scientific research...
 <br><br>


Taking these arguments (p.50) one-by-one it becomes clear just how bullshit this bullshit is. 
 <br><br>
1. the Cook article referenced here is from a previous publication by the Heartland Institute, itself heavily funded by the fossil fuel industry 
 <br><br>
2.  (THIS BOOK WAS PAID BY THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY), but also a quick reference to website before the flood shows that payments to climate deniers is more poignant then simply paying "scientists" as the root metric of the argument suggests, and is in no way vanising https://www.beforetheflood.com/explore/the-deniers/top-10-climate-deniers/. 
 <br><br>
3. Tricky red herring here. More funding for advocacy is still bias, but that does not mean that it is bias against truth, it means that it is bias against bullshit corporate shills. Additionally, the article this argument references talks about how a "boom" in climate denial and its effectiveness has lead to a "boom" in climate science--we are spending more money to combat climate denial because that denial is just so pervasive. 
 <br><br>
4. Not only is this unsupported argument false, (the most prominent organizations supporting climate denial get all of there money from the fossil fuel industry, albeit indirectly) but those individuals that this argument references are people like the Koch brothers who not only control fossil fuel empires but have a vested intrest in maintaining pro-fossil fuel policy. 
 <br><br>


The most aggravating thing about this is that unless you are writing a comment for a grade in a class and doing this type of digging and cross-referencing, not all of this BS is obvious. In fact, it's convoluted on purpose to try and convince people that climate denial is the underdog. No one should listen to this.

After reading the beginning of the book, I recognized the attempts to dispute climate change as I have seen them used time and time again by other outlets. All the usual talking points were hit, starting with the claim that not all scientists are in consensus about the issue. While this is technically true, it is almost impossible to get every person from different parts of the world to agree on one thing. The important thing to note, which was conveniently left out of the argument, is that extreme majority believe in climate change. Another claim seen was that the earth has gone through similar periods of temperature in its past. While also true, the current climate changes can be directly linked to human actions, unlike the ones that occurred millions of years ago. a third argument I saw was that while theoretically humans could have an impact on the climate, the extent of the impact is unknown and unmeasurable, and scientists claiming otherwise have some sort of political agenda. This is a common tactic used as it easy for someone with differing views to claim bias, and those who disagree with certain views are inclined to agree with the claims of bias. It is unfortunate to see how many people try to deny climate change and it was especially disturbing that these books were sent to schools and children with the intent of influencing their opions.

I started reading this article without realizing what I was reading. I kept waiting for the “but” to come but it never did. I fully agree and think the reading does an excellent job of persuading and planting the seeds of doubt in the reader's mind. What I find important to note however is the discussion of bias and faulty studies in the reading. I found this analysis very hypocritical given that this book was being funded by the Heartland institute, who regularly gets donations from the fossil fuel industry. 
 <br><br>
 The bias in this book is heavily evident, and has a clear agenda. It was frustrating to read as many of their arguments in the book are very clear and accessible to those who might not be educated on the subject. The book uses bias in their selection of studies conducted, only choosing those that they are able to find fault in. Sometimes the fault being as minor as not selecting enough participants in a sample case study. (It is impossible to interview every scientist who has knowledge of the climate crisis). In their attempt to destabilize the foundational arguments by targeting bias, the authors also fell victim to the same trap.


<br><hr>
I think your comment is pretty comprehensive. You mention three key points you see in the reading. The first point is that “not all scientists are in consensus about the issue.” The second point is that “the earth has gone through similar periods of temperature in its past.” The third one is that the impact of human on the climate is unknown and unmeasurable. Indeed, if children see this kind of book, their opinions will be influenced. It is hard to imagine how they would act after they grow up, because education is an essential part of a person’s life.

<br><hr>


I agree with you that bias and special interests can cloud the integrity of research and claims associated with it. This is what frustrates me about academia and debated like this in general is that the arguments against one side can just be turned back on the side refuting the argument. For example, the reading cites publication bias, resume padding, funding, and age gap as a reason for why pro-climate change research is flawed. These exact same reasons can be cited as to why the climate change deniers are wrong. The whole debate and others like it just turn into a cycle of blaming and accusation, which is frustrating. The other problem with this paper and others like it (on both sides) is that no layperson is going to fact check a scientific paper they are reading. We usually just take these papers as gospel and move on. This can be very problematic when there are compelling, well written, jargon-heavy papers presenting both sides. People simply don't know what to believe and just go with whatever argument speaks to them more or aligns most with their values and self-interests. Though I think they are wrong, I can see how people can be climate change deniers. If you live in a place that is not being visibly impacted by climate change, are relatively uneducated on the issue, and you read a paper like this, you are likely to be a climate change denier. These papers prey on people who don't know any better. What people should be asking is what motivation would NASA, the IPCC and other organizations have for faking climate change? Virtually none. What do the heartland institute and the scientists they employ have to gain from being skeptics? Millions of dollars in the form of fossil fuel industry contributions.

I think the campaign of disinformation in general was an interesting way to get people to believe climate change is not real. I can see how someone that does not have a position on climate change and hardly thinks about it can be persuaded by the piece to believe it is not real. The fact that they are teaching it to children is even more interesting as the people know that those children will grow up and have a strong belief that is not real and therefore repeat the same cycle. The angle the campaign is taking is one that many will fall into as they provided the book for free and for people that don’t want to believe climate change is real will easily rely on the books facts to refute climate change arguments. I feel like we have to take a bigger initiative to teach people that climate change is real so that we can transition into a more sustainable life.

 thanks for sharing your thoughts. Yes, it is very compelling finding out political groups are promoting false information regarding climate change. In a sense, it is a disgusting method to influence future generations and brainwashing them to believe climate change is fake. These researchers who put out anti-climate crisis propaganda are corrupting the public's understanding of climate change. If political agendas continue to publicize and promote false news among the public supported by scientists, soon we will not know what to believe. This presents a massive problem for those who want to do something about our climate because it prevents them from advocating climate action.
<br><hr>


I agree completely and I think that our society is at a point in history when proven information is nearly impossible to distinguish from disinformation. I believe that our generation has a long way to go before we can truly eliminate disinformation and anti-science based information from our exposure. By spreading this false media, divisions between groups are created and many are convinced of information that could be harmful. Without proper knowledge on climate change, there will no initiative to change our habits.
